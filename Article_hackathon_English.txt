Python: Selecting Certain Indexes in an Array!@#| More  A couple of days ago I was scrapping the UK parliament constituencies from Wikipedia in preparation for the Graph Connect hackathon and had got to the point where I had an array with one entry per column in the table. import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup from soupselect import select page = open("constituencies.html", 'r') soup = BeautifulSoup(page.read()) for row in select(soup, "table.wikitable tr"): if select(row, "th"): print [cell.text for cell in select(row, "th")] if select(row, "td"): print [cell.text for cell in select(row, "td")] $ python blog.py [u'Constituency', u'Electorate (2000)', u'Electorate (2010)', u'Largest Local Authority', u'Country of the UK'] [u'Aldershot', u'66,499', u'71,908', u'Hampshire', u'England'] [u'Aldridge-Brownhills', u'58,695', u'59,506', u'West Midlands', u'England'] [u'Altrincham and Sale West', u'69,605', u'72,008', u'Greater Manchester', u'England'] [u'Amber Valley', u'66,406', u'69,538', u'Derbyshire', u'England'] [u'Arundel and South Downs', u'71,203', u'76,697', u'West Sussex', u'England'] [u'Ashfield', u'74,674', u'77,049', u'Nottinghamshire', u'England'] [u'Ashford', u'72,501', u'81,947', u'Kent', u'England'] [u'Ashton-under-Lyne', u'67,334', u'68,553', u'Greater Manchester', u'England'] [u'Aylesbury', u'72,023', u'78,750', u'Buckinghamshire', u'England'] ...  I wanted to get rid of the 2nd and 3rd columns (containing the electorates) from the array since those aren’t interesting to me as I have another source where I’ve got that data from.  I was struggling to do this but two different Stack Overflow questions came to the rescue with suggestions to use enumerate to get the index of each column and then add to the list comprehension to filter appropriately.  First we’ll look at the filtering on a simple example. Imagine we have a list of 5 people: people = ["mark", "michael", "brian", "alistair", "jim"]  And we only want to keep the 1st, 4th and 5th people. We therefore only want to keep the values that exist in index positions 0,3 and 4 which we can do like this: >>> [x[1] for x in enumerate(people) if x[0] in [0,3,4]] ['mark', 'alistair', 'jim']  Now let’s apply the same approach to our constituencies data set: import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup from soupselect import select page = open("constituencies.html", 'r') soup = BeautifulSoup(page.read()) for row in select(soup, "table.wikitable tr"): if select(row, "th"): print [entry[1].text for entry in enumerate(select(row, "th")) if entry[0] in [0,3,4]] if select(row, "td"): print [entry[1].text for entry in enumerate(select(row, "td")) if entry[0] in [0,3,4]] $ python blog.py [u'Constituency', u'Largest Local Authority', u'Country of the UK'] [u'Aldershot', u'Hampshire', u'England'] [u'Aldridge-Brownhills', u'West Midlands', u'England'] [u'Altrincham and Sale West', u'Greater Manchester', u'England'] [u'Amber Valley', u'Derbyshire', u'England'] [u'Arundel and South Downs', u'West Sussex', u'England'] [u'Ashfield', u'Nottinghamshire', u'England'] [u'Ashford', u'Kent', u'England'] [u'Ashton-under-Lyne', u'Greater Manchester', u'England'] [u'Aylesbury', u'Buckinghamshire', u'England'] Published at DZone with permission of Mark Needham , author and DZone MVB.

Software Is Eating the World Download slides ▸ Here  Companies that were not previously in the technology space now find themselves competing with Google and Amazon on the speed of innovation. As the innovation cycle accelerates, companies must embrace rapid and constant change to both applications and their infrastructure, and find a way to deliver speed and agility of development without sacrificing reliability or efficiency of operations. In her Keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell, discussed how IT organizations can automate just-in-time assembly of application environments - each built for a specific purpose with the right infrastructure, components, service, data and tools - and deliver this automation to developers as a self-service. Victoria's keynote included remarks by Kira Makagon, EVP of Innovation at RingCentral, and Ratnakar Lavu, EVP of Digital Technology at Kohl's.  DevOps Summit Was a Terrific Event! ▸ Here  NoOps != No Operations Download slides ▸ Here  Shipping daily, injecting faults, and keeping an extremely high availability "without Ops"? Understand why NoOps does not mean no operations. Agile development methodologies require evolved operations to be successful.  In his keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, David Tesar, Microsoft Technical Evangelist on Microsoft Azure and DevOps, discussed how Microsoft teams that have made huge progress with a DevOps transformation effectively utilize operations staff and how challenges were overcome. Regardless of whether you are a startup or a mature enterprise, whether you are using PaaS, Micro Services, or Containerization, walk away with some practical tips where Ops can make a significant impact working with the development teams. Operational teams and functions are increasingly more important as the industry delivers software at a blazing pace.  DevOps Is Even More Important Than You Think The move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has added significant pace to the application development and deployment environment. When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time frames that were unimaginable a few years ago. The consequent move toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the development and operations sides to work very closely together. Thus, DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today.  This Lunchtime Power Panel at DevOps Summit was moderated by Andi Mann, VP of Strategic Solutions at CA Technologies. Monish Sharma, VP of Customer Success at ElasticBox; Myles Steinhauser, Software Development Engineer at Blue Box; Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell Inc.; and Mark Levy, Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Serena Software go beyond the basics in a discussion of why DevOps is not only important for transformation, but is mission-critical for enterprises that want to stay in business.  DevOps: Disruptive but Essential in a Cloud Expo ® Universe The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.  The DevOps Summit 2015 New York and Silicon Valley will be held:  DevOps Summit 2015 New York (June 9-11, 2015, at the Javits Center, Manhattan)  DevOps Summit 2015 Silicon Valley (November 3-5, 2015, at the Santa Clara Convention Center)  DevOps Summit, June 9-11, 2015, at the New York Javits Center in the heart of world's financial capital, will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of time enterprise IT professionals spend putting out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.  DevOps Summit content doubled in November from a single track last year in New York to two simultaneous tracks: "Dev" Developer Focus and "Ops" Operations Focus ,as well as high impact keynotes attended by over 1,000 delegates.  We'll see you in New York City! See you in June!

New Mobile App Could Help Empty Out Animal Shelters!@#0 IN PHOTO: A dog looks out of its at the animal welfare center in Tokushima, March 11, 2010. It's a dog's life for a stray mutt in any country, but in Japan a canine that ends up in the municipal pound is far more likely to be put down than to find a new home. While in some other industrialised countries the idea of "saving" a pet from a shelter is well-established, in Japan animal welfare activists say strays often fall foul of an attitude that prizes puppies and pedigrees as status symbols. Reuters/Kim Kyung-Hoon  A team of programmers have developed a new app that could help animal shelters . If there are many dating sites and apps, there is also a matchmaking platform for shelter dogs.  The app, called Pttr, works as a dating app, except it's for pets and it works by advertising those that are up for adoption from different shelters. Nature World News reports that student programmers from Florida International University, or FIU, designed the app as part of a global coding competition, the Smart City Challenge Hackathon.  The team chose to create the app to help lessen killing rates among shelters. According to the report, the team completed the project in only 48 hours. About 180 app designs were submitted to the competition and 38 designs moved forward, including Pttr, which is battling designs from places like China and New York.  Freshman Kennet Postigo, a Computer Science major from the university, explained that the app will help families who are looking to adopt find a good match. The team also hopes that the app will help shelters find permanent homes for the animals.  The app is much like an online shopping platform where families can browse pets for adoption based on the preference they have. At the same time, shelters can use the app to upload photos and provide description of the pets. It also features a "Like" button that allows families to bookmark the pet that has caught their attention. By the time they personally visit the shelter, they know which pet to look for.  Pttr is on its early stages and the developers hope that the app can become a national or global platform without giving regard to prize winnings. Currently, the app is a local project limited to cater to pet shelters in the Miami-Dade County only. It is also open-source, which means other programmers can tweak the app with the group’s approval.  "I definitely think this app will save animals' lives," said project coder Thomas Xavier "and if other developers can continue to do things like this, the app could be huge," he said as reported in Nature World News. The results of the competition will be given out by end of May.  To report problems or leave feedback on this article, email: wendylemeric@gmail.com.!@#english

Software Is Eating the World Download slides ▸ Here  Companies that were not previously in the technology space now find themselves competing with Google and Amazon on the speed of innovation. As the innovation cycle accelerates, companies must embrace rapid and constant change to both applications and their infrastructure, and find a way to deliver speed and agility of development without sacrificing reliability or efficiency of operations. In her Keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell, discussed how IT organizations can automate just-in-time assembly of application environments - each built for a specific purpose with the right infrastructure, components, service, data and tools - and deliver this automation to developers as a self-service. Victoria's keynote included remarks by Kira Makagon, EVP of Innovation at RingCentral, and Ratnakar Lavu, EVP of Digital Technology at Kohl's.  DevOps Summit Was a Terrific Event! ▸ Here  NoOps != No Operations Download slides ▸ Here  Shipping daily, injecting faults, and keeping an extremely high availability "without Ops"? Understand why NoOps does not mean no operations. Agile development methodologies require evolved operations to be successful.  In his keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, David Tesar, Microsoft Technical Evangelist on Microsoft Azure and DevOps, discussed how Microsoft teams that have made huge progress with a DevOps transformation effectively utilize operations staff and how challenges were overcome. Regardless of whether you are a startup or a mature enterprise, whether you are using PaaS, Micro Services, or Containerization, walk away with some practical tips where Ops can make a significant impact working with the development teams. Operational teams and functions are increasingly more important as the industry delivers software at a blazing pace.  DevOps Is Even More Important Than You Think The move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has added significant pace to the application development and deployment environment. When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time frames that were unimaginable a few years ago. The consequent move toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the development and operations sides to work very closely together. Thus, DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today.  This Lunchtime Power Panel at DevOps Summit was moderated by Andi Mann, VP of Strategic Solutions at CA Technologies. Monish Sharma, VP of Customer Success at ElasticBox; Myles Steinhauser, Software Development Engineer at Blue Box; Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell Inc.; and Mark Levy, Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Serena Software go beyond the basics in a discussion of why DevOps is not only important for transformation, but is mission-critical for enterprises that want to stay in business.  DevOps: Disruptive but Essential in a Cloud Expo ® Universe The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.  The DevOps Summit 2015 New York and Silicon Valley will be held:  DevOps Summit 2015 New York (June 9-11, 2015, at the Javits Center, Manhattan)  DevOps Summit 2015 Silicon Valley (November 3-5, 2015, at the Santa Clara Convention Center)  DevOps Summit, June 9-11, 2015, at the New York Javits Center in the heart of world's financial capital, will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of time enterprise IT professionals spend putting out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.  DevOps Summit content doubled in November from a single track last year in New York to two simultaneous tracks: "Dev" Developer Focus and "Ops" Operations Focus ,as well as high impact keynotes attended by over 1,000 delegates.

DevOps Power Panel at @DevOpsSummit Silicon Valley [#DevOps]!@#DevOps Power Panel at @DevOpsSummit Silicon Valley [#DevOps] DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today May 7, 2015 02:30 AM EDT Reads: Blog This  The move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has added significant pace to the application development and deployment environment.  When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time frames that were unimaginable a few years ago.  The consequent move toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the development and operations sides to work very closely together.  Thus, DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today.  This Lunchtime Power Panel at DevOps Summit was moderated by Andi Mann, VP of Strategic Solutions at CA Technologies. Monish Sharma, VP of Customer Success at ElasticBox; Myles Steinhauser, Software Development Engineer at Blue Box; Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell Inc.; and Mark Levy, Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Serena Software go beyond the basics in a discussion of why DevOps is not only important for transformation, but is mission-critical for enterprises that want to stay in business.  Software Is Eating the World Download slides ▸ Here  Companies that were not previously in the technology space now find themselves competing with Google and Amazon on the speed of innovation. As the innovation cycle accelerates, companies must embrace rapid and constant change to both applications and their infrastructure, and find a way to deliver speed and agility of development without sacrificing reliability or efficiency of operations. In her Keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell, discussed how IT organizations can automate just-in-time assembly of application environments - each built for a specific purpose with the right infrastructure, components, service, data and tools - and deliver this automation to developers as a self-service. Victoria's keynote included remarks by Kira Makagon, EVP of Innovation at RingCentral, and Ratnakar Lavu, EVP of Digital Technology at Kohl's.  DevOps Summit Was a Terrific Event! ▸ Here  NoOps != No Operations Download slides ▸ Here  Shipping daily, injecting faults, and keeping an extremely high availability "without Ops"? Understand why NoOps does not mean no operations. Agile development methodologies require evolved operations to be successful.  In his keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, David Tesar, Microsoft Technical Evangelist on Microsoft Azure and DevOps, discussed how Microsoft teams that have made huge progress with a DevOps transformation effectively utilize operations staff and how challenges were overcome. Regardless of whether you are a startup or a mature enterprise, whether you are using PaaS, Micro Services, or Containerization, walk away with some practical tips where Ops can make a significant impact working with the development teams. Operational teams and functions are increasingly more important as the industry delivers software at a blazing pace.  DevOps Is Even More Important Than You Think The move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has added significant pace to the application development and deployment environment. When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time frames that were unimaginable a few years ago. The consequent move toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the development and operations sides to work very closely together. Thus, DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today.  This Lunchtime Power Panel at DevOps Summit was moderated by Andi Mann, VP of Strategic Solutions at CA Technologies.

DevOps: Disruptive but Essential in a Cloud Expo ® Universe The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.  The DevOps Summit 2015 New York and Silicon Valley will be held:  DevOps Summit 2015 New York (June 9-11, 2015, at the Javits Center, Manhattan)  DevOps Summit 2015 Silicon Valley (November 3-5, 2015, at the Santa Clara Convention Center)  DevOps Summit, June 9-11, 2015, at the New York Javits Center in the heart of world's financial capital, will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of time enterprise IT professionals spend putting out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.  DevOps Summit content doubled in November from a single track last year in New York to two simultaneous tracks: "Dev" Developer Focus and "Ops" Operations Focus ,as well as high impact keynotes attended by over 1,000 delegates.

A Focus on the Operations Model with @NuoDB | @CloudExpo [#Cloud]!@#Blog This  NuoDB just introduced the Swifts 2.1 Release. In this demo at 15th Cloud Expo , Seth Proctor, CTO of NuoDB, Inc., discussed why scaling databases in the cloud is challenging, why building your application on top of the infrastructure that is designed with this in mind makes a difference, and what you can do with NuoDB that simplifies your programming model, your operations model.  "NuoDB is a transactionally consistent SQL database that does scale out, that does all the things you want in a cloud. If you want more transactional throughput, if you want higher availability, if you want to run in multiple data centers, this is a technology that can scale and still provide a single logical consistent database," explained Seth Proctor, CTO of NuoDB, in this SYS-CON.tv interview at Cloud Expo , held Nov 4-6, 2014, at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, CA.  As more applications and services move "to the cloud" (public or on-premise) cloud environments are increasingly adopting and building out traditional enterprise features. This in turn is enabling and encouraging cloud adoption from enterprise users. In many ways the definition is blurring as features like continuous operation, geo-distribution or on-demand capacity become the norm. NuoDB is involved in both building enterprise software and using enterprise cloud capabilities.  In his session at 15th Cloud Expo , Seth Proctor, CTO at NuoDB, Inc., discussed the experiences from building, deploying and using enterprise services and suggest some ways to approach moving enterprise applications into a cloud model.  Seth Proctor's NuoDB presentation at Cloud Expo 2014 New York Demo Theater  Speaker Bio: Seth Proctor has 15+ years of experience in the research, design and implementation of scalable systems. That experience includes work on distributed computing, networks, security, languages, operating systems and databases. His particular focus is on how to make technology scale and how to make users scale effectively with their systems. Seth currently serves as the Chief Technology Officer of NuoDB. He holds eight patents for his cutting edge work across several technical disciplines. He has five additional patents awaiting approval, all related to achieving greater database efficiency and end-user agility in decentralized database deployments.  Cloud, Big Data, and the 'Internet of Things'  Are you ready to put your data in the cloud?  What is the future of security in the cloud?  Does Docker quickly advance the development of an IoT application?  What are the implications of Moore's Law on Hadoop deployments?

!@#I'm not sure what it's like in Bosnia, but you should definitely be able to do at least one of the things I list here. For music, as /u/Fartin_dog said, go to concerts and festivals. For comics and games, go to a comic book shop or board game shop or somewhere similar. They will often have nights where you can just show up and play games. A typical "thing," at least here in the US, is Friday Night Magic. For reddit... well, you're talking to us. You could try checking out the Bosnia subreddit, which appears to be /r/bih, if you want to meet people closer to you. (I don't think reddit as a shared interest is good enough to warrant real life social interaction, but that's my opinion) For software development, like /u/hexirost said, hackathons are a good idea. There are also great online communities for obvious reasons. For those educational sciences, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe try going to talks at universities near you? Or take classes for them. You're sure to meet people there. For fencing and karate, I'm not sure how you do those unless you're doing it with other people. In which case... you don't need my help? But if you're just *interested* in those things, and haven't been *doing* them, then why not sign up for them?!@#english
!@#If your into software development and programming consider a hackathon. You could also look around to see if there are any events around your area. Don't be afraid to go to different places, you can leave at any time. Also if you wanna just talk to other people go to online sites like omegle, usually you get a crappy person but after like half a dozen you might get a decent person to talk to.!@#english

DevOps and the 'Internet of Things' | @ThingsExpo [#IoT #DevOps]!@#Blog This  Download Slide Deck: ▸ Here  Enthusiasm for the Internet of Things has reached an all-time high. In 2013 alone, venture capitalists spent more than $1 billion dollars investing in the IoT space. With "smart" appliances and devices, IoT covers wearable smart devices, cloud services to hardware companies. Nest, a Google company, detects temperatures inside homes and automatically adjusts it by tracking its user's habit. These technologies are quickly developing and with it come challenges such as bridging infrastructure gaps, abiding by privacy concerns and making the concept a reality. These challenges can't be addressed without the kinds of agile software development and infrastructure approaches pioneered by the DevOps movement.  In her session at @ThingsExpo , Rachel Chalmers, Principal at Ignition Partner, discussed an investor's perspective on the IoT, provided an overview of the potential barriers such as security and interoperability for widespread adoption, and how DevOps can help overcome these barriers.  Key messages: What the IoT means for personal security and privacy Widespread adoption of the IoT and what this means for the future How to use DevOps to fill in the gaps  Speaker Bio: Rachel Chalmers joined Ignition as a principal in 2013. She sources deals in enterprise and cloud infrastructure, "Big Data" and the "Internet of Things"; advises portfolio companies and provides counsel on industry trends.  Prior to Ignition, Rachel worked for 13 years at the 451 Group, an independent technology industry analyst firm focused on the business of enterprise IT innovation. She was most recently the company's vice president of research, overseeing all work on enterprise infrastructure software. Coverage areas included hypervisors, operating systems, provisioning and automation, application development, performance monitoring and lifecycle management. While at 451, Rachel was among the first analysts to cover Opsware, BladeLogic, VMware, Splunk and Cloudera.  Before becoming a technology analyst, Rachel was a journalist in the U.S. and Australia. She helped launch Computer Week, later PC Week Australia, and was the Internet editor for Computerwire, where she wrote about software and open-source technologies.  Rachel received a BA in English from the University of Sydney and a master's in philosophy, with a focus on Anglo-Irish literature, from Trinity College, Dublin. She is an advisor to the Ada Initiative, a non-profit that supports women in open technology and culture.  Cloud, Big Data, and the 'Internet of Things'  Are you ready to put your data in the cloud?

DevOps and the 'Internet of Things' | @ThingsExpo [#IoT #DevOps]!@#Blog This  Download Slide Deck: ▸ Here  Enthusiasm for the Internet of Things has reached an all-time high. In 2013 alone, venture capitalists spent more than $1 billion dollars investing in the IoT space. With "smart" appliances and devices, IoT covers wearable smart devices, cloud services to hardware companies. Nest, a Google company, detects temperatures inside homes and automatically adjusts it by tracking its user's habit. These technologies are quickly developing and with it come challenges such as bridging infrastructure gaps, abiding by privacy concerns and making the concept a reality. These challenges can't be addressed without the kinds of agile software development and infrastructure approaches pioneered by the DevOps movement.  In her session at @ThingsExpo , Rachel Chalmers, Principal at Ignition Partner, discussed an investor's perspective on the IoT, provided an overview of the potential barriers such as security and interoperability for widespread adoption, and how DevOps can help overcome these barriers.  Key messages: What the IoT means for personal security and privacy Widespread adoption of the IoT and what this means for the future How to use DevOps to fill in the gaps  Speaker Bio: Rachel Chalmers joined Ignition as a principal in 2013. She sources deals in enterprise and cloud infrastructure, "Big Data" and the "Internet of Things"; advises portfolio companies and provides counsel on industry trends.  Prior to Ignition, Rachel worked for 13 years at the 451 Group, an independent technology industry analyst firm focused on the business of enterprise IT innovation. She was most recently the company's vice president of research, overseeing all work on enterprise infrastructure software. Coverage areas included hypervisors, operating systems, provisioning and automation, application development, performance monitoring and lifecycle management. While at 451, Rachel was among the first analysts to cover Opsware, BladeLogic, VMware, Splunk and Cloudera.  Before becoming a technology analyst, Rachel was a journalist in the U.S. and Australia. She helped launch Computer Week, later PC Week Australia, and was the Internet editor for Computerwire, where she wrote about software and open-source technologies.  Rachel received a BA in English from the University of Sydney and a master's in philosophy, with a focus on Anglo-Irish literature, from Trinity College, Dublin. She is an advisor to the Ada Initiative, a non-profit that supports women in open technology and culture.  Cloud, Big Data, and the 'Internet of Things'  Are you ready to put your data in the cloud?

DevOps and the 'Internet of Things' | @ThingsExpo [#IoT #DevOps]!@#Blog This  Download Slide Deck: ▸ Here  Enthusiasm for the Internet of Things has reached an all-time high. In 2013 alone, venture capitalists spent more than $1 billion dollars investing in the IoT space. With "smart" appliances and devices, IoT covers wearable smart devices, cloud services to hardware companies. Nest, a Google company, detects temperatures inside homes and automatically adjusts it by tracking its user's habit. These technologies are quickly developing and with it come challenges such as bridging infrastructure gaps, abiding by privacy concerns and making the concept a reality. These challenges can't be addressed without the kinds of agile software development and infrastructure approaches pioneered by the DevOps movement.  In her session at @ThingsExpo , Rachel Chalmers, Principal at Ignition Partner, discussed an investor's perspective on the IoT, provided an overview of the potential barriers such as security and interoperability for widespread adoption, and how DevOps can help overcome these barriers.  Key messages: What the IoT means for personal security and privacy Widespread adoption of the IoT and what this means for the future How to use DevOps to fill in the gaps  Speaker Bio: Rachel Chalmers joined Ignition as a principal in 2013. She sources deals in enterprise and cloud infrastructure, "Big Data" and the "Internet of Things"; advises portfolio companies and provides counsel on industry trends.  Prior to Ignition, Rachel worked for 13 years at the 451 Group, an independent technology industry analyst firm focused on the business of enterprise IT innovation. She was most recently the company's vice president of research, overseeing all work on enterprise infrastructure software. Coverage areas included hypervisors, operating systems, provisioning and automation, application development, performance monitoring and lifecycle management. While at 451, Rachel was among the first analysts to cover Opsware, BladeLogic, VMware, Splunk and Cloudera.  Before becoming a technology analyst, Rachel was a journalist in the U.S. and Australia. She helped launch Computer Week, later PC Week Australia, and was the Internet editor for Computerwire, where she wrote about software and open-source technologies.  Rachel received a BA in English from the University of Sydney and a master's in philosophy, with a focus on Anglo-Irish literature, from Trinity College, Dublin. She is an advisor to the Ada Initiative, a non-profit that supports women in open technology and culture.  Cloud, Big Data, and the 'Internet of Things'  Are you ready to put your data in the cloud?

DevOps Power Panel at @DevOpsSummit Silicon Valley [#DevOps]!@#DevOps Power Panel at @DevOpsSummit Silicon Valley [#DevOps] DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today May 7, 2015 02:30 AM EDT Reads: Blog This  The move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has added significant pace to the application development and deployment environment.  When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time frames that were unimaginable a few years ago.  The consequent move toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the development and operations sides to work very closely together.  Thus, DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today.  This Lunchtime Power Panel at DevOps Summit was moderated by Andi Mann, VP of Strategic Solutions at CA Technologies. Monish Sharma, VP of Customer Success at ElasticBox; Myles Steinhauser, Software Development Engineer at Blue Box; Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell Inc.; and Mark Levy, Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Serena Software go beyond the basics in a discussion of why DevOps is not only important for transformation, but is mission-critical for enterprises that want to stay in business.  Software Is Eating the World Download slides ▸ Here  Companies that were not previously in the technology space now find themselves competing with Google and Amazon on the speed of innovation. As the innovation cycle accelerates, companies must embrace rapid and constant change to both applications and their infrastructure, and find a way to deliver speed and agility of development without sacrificing reliability or efficiency of operations. In her Keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell, discussed how IT organizations can automate just-in-time assembly of application environments - each built for a specific purpose with the right infrastructure, components, service, data and tools - and deliver this automation to developers as a self-service. Victoria's keynote included remarks by Kira Makagon, EVP of Innovation at RingCentral, and Ratnakar Lavu, EVP of Digital Technology at Kohl's.  DevOps Summit Was a Terrific Event! ▸ Here  NoOps != No Operations Download slides ▸ Here  Shipping daily, injecting faults, and keeping an extremely high availability "without Ops"? Understand why NoOps does not mean no operations. Agile development methodologies require evolved operations to be successful.  In his keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, David Tesar, Microsoft Technical Evangelist on Microsoft Azure and DevOps, discussed how Microsoft teams that have made huge progress with a DevOps transformation effectively utilize operations staff and how challenges were overcome. Regardless of whether you are a startup or a mature enterprise, whether you are using PaaS, Micro Services, or Containerization, walk away with some practical tips where Ops can make a significant impact working with the development teams. Operational teams and functions are increasingly more important as the industry delivers software at a blazing pace.  DevOps Is Even More Important Than You Think The move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has added significant pace to the application development and deployment environment. When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time frames that were unimaginable a few years ago. The consequent move toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the development and operations sides to work very closely together. Thus, DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today.  This Lunchtime Power Panel at DevOps Summit was moderated by Andi Mann, VP of Strategic Solutions at CA Technologies. Monish Sharma, VP of Customer Success at ElasticBox; Myles Steinhauser, Software Development Engineer at Blue Box; Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell Inc.; and Mark Levy, Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Serena Software go beyond the basics in a discussion of why DevOps is not only important for transformation, but is mission-critical for enterprises that want to stay in business.  DevOps: Disruptive but Essential in a Cloud Expo ® Universe The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.  The DevOps Summit 2015 New York and Silicon Valley will be held:  DevOps Summit 2015 New York (June 9-11, 2015, at the Javits Center, Manhattan)  DevOps Summit 2015 Silicon Valley (November 3-5, 2015, at the Santa Clara Convention Center)  DevOps Summit, June 9-11, 2015, at the New York Javits Center in the heart of world's financial capital, will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of time enterprise IT professionals spend putting out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.  DevOps Summit content doubled in November from a single track last year in New York to two simultaneous tracks: "Dev" Developer Focus and "Ops" Operations Focus ,as well as high impact keynotes attended by over 1,000 delegates.  We'll see you in New York City! See you in June!

Software Is Eating the World Download slides ▸ Here  Companies that were not previously in the technology space now find themselves competing with Google and Amazon on the speed of innovation. As the innovation cycle accelerates, companies must embrace rapid and constant change to both applications and their infrastructure, and find a way to deliver speed and agility of development without sacrificing reliability or efficiency of operations. In her Keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell, discussed how IT organizations can automate just-in-time assembly of application environments - each built for a specific purpose with the right infrastructure, components, service, data and tools - and deliver this automation to developers as a self-service. Victoria's keynote included remarks by Kira Makagon, EVP of Innovation at RingCentral, and Ratnakar Lavu, EVP of Digital Technology at Kohl's.  DevOps Summit Was a Terrific Event! ▸ Here  NoOps != No Operations Download slides ▸ Here  Shipping daily, injecting faults, and keeping an extremely high availability "without Ops"? Understand why NoOps does not mean no operations. Agile development methodologies require evolved operations to be successful.  In his keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, David Tesar, Microsoft Technical Evangelist on Microsoft Azure and DevOps, discussed how Microsoft teams that have made huge progress with a DevOps transformation effectively utilize operations staff and how challenges were overcome. Regardless of whether you are a startup or a mature enterprise, whether you are using PaaS, Micro Services, or Containerization, walk away with some practical tips where Ops can make a significant impact working with the development teams. Operational teams and functions are increasingly more important as the industry delivers software at a blazing pace.  DevOps Is Even More Important Than You Think The move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has added significant pace to the application development and deployment environment. When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time frames that were unimaginable a few years ago. The consequent move toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the development and operations sides to work very closely together. Thus, DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today.  This Lunchtime Power Panel at DevOps Summit was moderated by Andi Mann, VP of Strategic Solutions at CA Technologies. Monish Sharma, VP of Customer Success at ElasticBox; Myles Steinhauser, Software Development Engineer at Blue Box; Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell Inc.; and Mark Levy, Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Serena Software go beyond the basics in a discussion of why DevOps is not only important for transformation, but is mission-critical for enterprises that want to stay in business.  DevOps: Disruptive but Essential in a Cloud Expo ® Universe The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.  The DevOps Summit 2015 New York and Silicon Valley will be held:  DevOps Summit 2015 New York (June 9-11, 2015, at the Javits Center, Manhattan)  DevOps Summit 2015 Silicon Valley (November 3-5, 2015, at the Santa Clara Convention Center)  DevOps Summit, June 9-11, 2015, at the New York Javits Center in the heart of world's financial capital, will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of time enterprise IT professionals spend putting out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.  DevOps Summit content doubled in November from a single track last year in New York to two simultaneous tracks: "Dev" Developer Focus and "Ops" Operations Focus ,as well as high impact keynotes attended by over 1,000 delegates.

Performance1 Launches Free Online Personality Test That Helps Business Leaders Improve How They Act, Relate and Think!@#News Feed Item Performance1 Launches Free Online Personality Test That Helps Business Leaders Improve How They Act, Relate and Think May 7, 2015 03:31 AM EDT Blog This  LONDON , May 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --  Performance1 announces the launch of the "ART of Performance diagnostic," a free online personality test that identifies a business leader's profile in one of 7 common performance patterns that interfere with peak performance. The Art of Performance approach develops a leader's ability to Act, Relate and Think.  (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150507/743497 )  Performance1, the Executive coaching team that specializes in transferring insights from Olympic sports into business, uses a simple yet powerful model to underpin their approach to executive coaching. It is called the ART of Performance and it is based on working with successful leaders in sport and business.  "We have found that Performance falls short when Action, Relating and Thinking are disconnected or underdeveloped," observed Founder, Jonathan Males . "We've identified 7 common patterns or disconnects that interfere with peak performance. The 'ART of Performance diagnostic' tool quickly helps business leaders assess their performance in terms of how they act, think and relate, and then we work with them to develop their abilities in order to deliver peak business performance."  The test is available online at http://www.testmyperformance.com . There are 30 self-rating questions. It takes 5 minutes to complete. And then you will receive a tailored report with embedded video and helpful advice.  Darren Fergus , Why Health CEO, said, "I learned as much about my leadership in five minutes from the ART of Performance as I did from a 30-page feedback report. It really described my style and what I needed to do differently."

All doubt was removed when IBM and HP threw up their respective DevOps microsites. Where are we on the hype cycle? It's hard to say for sure but there's a feeling we're heading for the "Peak of Inflated Expectations." What does this mean for the enterprise? Should they avoid DevOps? Definitely not.

DevOps and the 'Internet of Things' | @ThingsExpo [#IoT #DevOps]!@#Blog This  Download Slide Deck: ▸ Here  Enthusiasm for the Internet of Things has reached an all-time high. In 2013 alone, venture capitalists spent more than $1 billion dollars investing in the IoT space. With "smart" appliances and devices, IoT covers wearable smart devices, cloud services to hardware companies. Nest, a Google company, detects temperatures inside homes and automatically adjusts it by tracking its user's habit. These technologies are quickly developing and with it come challenges such as bridging infrastructure gaps, abiding by privacy concerns and making the concept a reality. These challenges can't be addressed without the kinds of agile software development and infrastructure approaches pioneered by the DevOps movement.  In her session at @ThingsExpo , Rachel Chalmers, Principal at Ignition Partner, discussed an investor's perspective on the IoT, provided an overview of the potential barriers such as security and interoperability for widespread adoption, and how DevOps can help overcome these barriers.  Key messages: What the IoT means for personal security and privacy Widespread adoption of the IoT and what this means for the future How to use DevOps to fill in the gaps  Speaker Bio: Rachel Chalmers joined Ignition as a principal in 2013. She sources deals in enterprise and cloud infrastructure, "Big Data" and the "Internet of Things"; advises portfolio companies and provides counsel on industry trends.  Prior to Ignition, Rachel worked for 13 years at the 451 Group, an independent technology industry analyst firm focused on the business of enterprise IT innovation. She was most recently the company's vice president of research, overseeing all work on enterprise infrastructure software. Coverage areas included hypervisors, operating systems, provisioning and automation, application development, performance monitoring and lifecycle management. While at 451, Rachel was among the first analysts to cover Opsware, BladeLogic, VMware, Splunk and Cloudera.  Before becoming a technology analyst, Rachel was a journalist in the U.S. and Australia.

DevOps Power Panel at @DevOpsSummit Silicon Valley [#DevOps]!@#DevOps Power Panel at @DevOpsSummit Silicon Valley [#DevOps] DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today May 7, 2015 02:30 AM EDT Reads: Blog This  The move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has added significant pace to the application development and deployment environment.  When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time frames that were unimaginable a few years ago.  The consequent move toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the development and operations sides to work very closely together.  Thus, DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today.  This Lunchtime Power Panel at DevOps Summit was moderated by Andi Mann, VP of Strategic Solutions at CA Technologies. Monish Sharma, VP of Customer Success at ElasticBox; Myles Steinhauser, Software Development Engineer at Blue Box; Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell Inc.; and Mark Levy, Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Serena Software go beyond the basics in a discussion of why DevOps is not only important for transformation, but is mission-critical for enterprises that want to stay in business.  Software Is Eating the World Download slides ▸ Here  Companies that were not previously in the technology space now find themselves competing with Google and Amazon on the speed of innovation. As the innovation cycle accelerates, companies must embrace rapid and constant change to both applications and their infrastructure, and find a way to deliver speed and agility of development without sacrificing reliability or efficiency of operations. In her Keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell, discussed how IT organizations can automate just-in-time assembly of application environments - each built for a specific purpose with the right infrastructure, components, service, data and tools - and deliver this automation to developers as a self-service. Victoria's keynote included remarks by Kira Makagon, EVP of Innovation at RingCentral, and Ratnakar Lavu, EVP of Digital Technology at Kohl's.  DevOps Summit Was a Terrific Event! ▸ Here  NoOps != No Operations Download slides ▸ Here  Shipping daily, injecting faults, and keeping an extremely high availability "without Ops"? Understand why NoOps does not mean no operations. Agile development methodologies require evolved operations to be successful.  In his keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, David Tesar, Microsoft Technical Evangelist on Microsoft Azure and DevOps, discussed how Microsoft teams that have made huge progress with a DevOps transformation effectively utilize operations staff and how challenges were overcome. Regardless of whether you are a startup or a mature enterprise, whether you are using PaaS, Micro Services, or Containerization, walk away with some practical tips where Ops can make a significant impact working with the development teams. Operational teams and functions are increasingly more important as the industry delivers software at a blazing pace.  DevOps Is Even More Important Than You Think The move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has added significant pace to the application development and deployment environment. When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time frames that were unimaginable a few years ago. The consequent move toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the development and operations sides to work very closely together.

DevOps: Disruptive but Essential in a Cloud Expo ® Universe The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.  The DevOps Summit 2015 New York and Silicon Valley will be held:  DevOps Summit 2015 New York (June 9-11, 2015, at the Javits Center, Manhattan)  DevOps Summit 2015 Silicon Valley (November 3-5, 2015, at the Santa Clara Convention Center)  DevOps Summit, June 9-11, 2015, at the New York Javits Center in the heart of world's financial capital, will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of time enterprise IT professionals spend putting out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.  DevOps Summit content doubled in November from a single track last year in New York to two simultaneous tracks: "Dev" Developer Focus and "Ops" Operations Focus ,as well as high impact keynotes attended by over 1,000 delegates.

A Focus on the Operations Model with @NuoDB | @CloudExpo [#Cloud]!@#Blog This  NuoDB just introduced the Swifts 2.1 Release. In this demo at 15th Cloud Expo , Seth Proctor, CTO of NuoDB, Inc., discussed why scaling databases in the cloud is challenging, why building your application on top of the infrastructure that is designed with this in mind makes a difference, and what you can do with NuoDB that simplifies your programming model, your operations model.  "NuoDB is a transactionally consistent SQL database that does scale out, that does all the things you want in a cloud. If you want more transactional throughput, if you want higher availability, if you want to run in multiple data centers, this is a technology that can scale and still provide a single logical consistent database," explained Seth Proctor, CTO of NuoDB, in this SYS-CON.tv interview at Cloud Expo , held Nov 4-6, 2014, at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, CA.  As more applications and services move "to the cloud" (public or on-premise) cloud environments are increasingly adopting and building out traditional enterprise features. This in turn is enabling and encouraging cloud adoption from enterprise users. In many ways the definition is blurring as features like continuous operation, geo-distribution or on-demand capacity become the norm. NuoDB is involved in both building enterprise software and using enterprise cloud capabilities.  In his session at 15th Cloud Expo , Seth Proctor, CTO at NuoDB, Inc., discussed the experiences from building, deploying and using enterprise services and suggest some ways to approach moving enterprise applications into a cloud model.  Seth Proctor's NuoDB presentation at Cloud Expo 2014 New York Demo Theater  Speaker Bio: Seth Proctor has 15+ years of experience in the research, design and implementation of scalable systems. That experience includes work on distributed computing, networks, security, languages, operating systems and databases. His particular focus is on how to make technology scale and how to make users scale effectively with their systems. Seth currently serves as the Chief Technology Officer of NuoDB. He holds eight patents for his cutting edge work across several technical disciplines. He has five additional patents awaiting approval, all related to achieving greater database efficiency and end-user agility in decentralized database deployments.

More DevOps Stories Than All Others Combined By @DevOpsSummit [#DevOps]!@#More DevOps Stories Than All Others Combined By @DevOpsSummit [#DevOps] DevOpsSummit Blog, with over 4,000 original articles, offers more content than all other source combined May 7, 2015 04:15 AM EDT Reads: Blog This  SYS-CON Media announced today that 9 out of 10 " most read" DevOps articles are published by @DevOpsSummit Blog .  Launched in October 2014, @DevOpsSummit Blog offers top articles, news stories, and blog posts from the world's well-known experts and guarantees better exposure for its authors than any other publication.  The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT.  Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch.  DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.  @DevOpsSummit Blog can be bookmarked ▸ Here  DevOps Journal is focused on this essential enterprise IT topic and brings valuable information to DevOps professionals who are transforming the way enterprise IT is done.  Launched in 2014, @DevOpsSummit Blog already published 3,995 original articles, blog posts, and news stories in less than a year.  Software Is Eating the World Download slides ▸ Here  Companies that were not previously in the technology space now find themselves competing with Google and Amazon on the speed of innovation. As the innovation cycle accelerates, companies must embrace rapid and constant change to both applications and their infrastructure, and find a way to deliver speed and agility of development without sacrificing reliability or efficiency of operations. In her Keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell, discussed how IT organizations can automate just-in-time assembly of application environments - each built for a specific purpose with the right infrastructure, components, service, data and tools - and deliver this automation to developers as a self-service. Victoria's keynote included remarks by Kira Makagon, EVP of Innovation at RingCentral, and Ratnakar Lavu, EVP of Digital Technology at Kohl's.  DevOps Summit Was a Terrific Event! ▸ Here  NoOps != No Operations Download slides ▸ Here  Shipping daily, injecting faults, and keeping an extremely high availability "without Ops"? Understand why NoOps does not mean no operations. Agile development methodologies require evolved operations to be successful.  In his keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, David Tesar, Microsoft Technical Evangelist on Microsoft Azure and DevOps, discussed how Microsoft teams that have made huge progress with a DevOps transformation effectively utilize operations staff and how challenges were overcome. Regardless of whether you are a startup or a mature enterprise, whether you are using PaaS, Micro Services, or Containerization, walk away with some practical tips where Ops can make a significant impact working with the development teams. Operational teams and functions are increasingly more important as the industry delivers software at a blazing pace.  DevOps Is Even More Important Than You Think The move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has added significant pace to the application development and deployment environment. When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time frames that were unimaginable a few years ago. The consequent move toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the development and operations sides to work very closely together. Thus, DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today.  This Lunchtime Power Panel at DevOps Summit was moderated by Andi Mann, VP of Strategic Solutions at CA Technologies. Monish Sharma, VP of Customer Success at ElasticBox; Myles Steinhauser, Software Development Engineer at Blue Box; Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell Inc.; and Mark Levy, Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Serena Software go beyond the basics in a discussion of why DevOps is not only important for transformation, but is mission-critical for enterprises that want to stay in business.  DevOps: Disruptive but Essential in a Cloud Expo ® Universe The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.  The DevOps Summit 2015 New York and Silicon Valley will be held:  DevOps Summit 2015 New York (June 9-11, 2015, at the Javits Center, Manhattan)  DevOps Summit 2015 Silicon Valley (November 3-5, 2015, at the Santa Clara Convention Center)  DevOps Summit, June 9-11, 2015, at the New York Javits Center in the heart of world's financial capital, will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of time enterprise IT professionals spend putting out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.  DevOps Summit content doubled in November from a single track last year in New York to two simultaneous tracks: "Dev" Developer Focus and "Ops" Operations Focus ,as well as high impact keynotes attended by over 1,000 delegates.

SoftLayer "Platform Track" at @CloudExpo | @SoftLayer | [#IoT #DevOps]!@#Blog This  Cloud is not a commodity. And no matter what you call it, computing doesn't come out of the sky. It comes from physical hardware inside brick and mortar facilities connected by hundreds of miles of networking cable. And no two clouds are built the same way.  SoftLayer gives you the highest performing cloud infrastructure available. One platform that takes data centers around the world that are full of the widest range of cloud computing options, and then integrates and automates everything.  Join SoftLayer on June 9 at 16th Cloud Expo to learn about IBM Cloud's SoftLayer platform, explore several of the API endpoints available with SoftLayer, and see how to get your application deployed in an agile way.  Developing with SoftLayer, an IBM Company - 11:00 - 11:35 am Speaker: Phil Jackson An introduction to IBM Cloud's SoftLayer platform, including some of the most useful services and how to best make use of them in your projects. Take a walk through the SoftLayer portal, see a demonstration of the capabilities of the API, and get some well-rounded advice on how to succeed on SoftLayer's platform.  Speaker Bio: As Lead Technology Evangelist, Phil Jackson helps SoftLayer customers and partners integrate with the company's platform.

With a passion for technology that started at a young age, Jackson has developed skills in a variety of scripting and programming languages and enjoys sharing his knowledge with the technology community.  Software for the Cloud with the SoftLayer Cloud - 1:55 - 2:30 pm Speaker: Harold Hannon Cloud providers are offering an ever-growing catalog of services. In this session, Hannon will review use cases for aggregating these services to create common application architectures for the cloud. He will explore several of the API endpoints available with SoftLayer and an example implementation using Python. Experience with Python is not required, but it is helpful. The principles and design of the application will apply to any of the API-language bindings available from SoftLayer.  Speaker Bio: Harold Hannon, a Senior Software Architect for SoftLayer, an IBM Company, has worked in the field of software development as both an architect and developer for more than 15 years, with a focus on workflow, integration, and distributed systems.

Recombinant and Prophylactic Treatments Boost Global Haemophilia Therapeutics Market!@#Recombinant and Prophylactic Treatments Boost Global Haemophilia Therapeutics Market Haemophilia B segment will see high growth over the forecast period, finds Frost & Sullivan May 7, 2015 04:45 AM EDT Blog This  LONDON , May 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Increased uptake of recombinant therapies and prophylactic use , coupled with improved diagnosis of haemophilia, is expected to drive the associated therapeutics market. Recombinant therapies are likely to command a premium price and fuel growth in developed markets, while heightened access to treatment and larger patient volumes due to more funding for critical care are anticipated to contribute to demand in emerging markets.  Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150507/214499LOGO  New analysis from Frost & Sullivan, Global Haemophilia Therapeutics Market , finds that the market earned revenues of $9.98 billion in 2014 and estimates this to reach $13.43 billion in 2019 . The study covers haemophilia A and Von Willebrand disease (factor VIII/von Willebrand factor), haemophilia B (factor IX), inhibitors (factor VIIa), and novel therapies in the pipeline.  For complimentary access to more information on this research, please visit: http://corpcom.frost.com/forms/EU_PR_AZanchi_MAD9-52_30Apr15 .  Currently, plasma-derived therapies account for nearly 30 percent of haemophilia A therapeutics sales, 41 percent of haemophilia B therapeutics sales, and 25 percent of the inhibitors market. Over time, however, adults are likely to switch to prophylaxis therapies due to the lucrative benefits offered by these long-lasting products compared to plasma-derived products.  "The haemophilia B segment is set to gain traction as newer products are far more convenient than established therapies," said Frost & Sullivan Healthcare Industry Analyst Aiswariya Chidambaram . "In contrast, the haemophilia A segment could lose some pace, with none of the recently launched or pipeline FVIII therapies able to extend product half-life by more than 60 percent."  With several new recombinant products in the market, a rise in price pressure is anticipated. This, along with negotiated discounts in emerging markets, could hamper the development of the global haemophilia therapeutics market.  Newer recombinant therapies will gradually capture share from leading players, posing more of a long-term threat to the market. This is because market entrants such as Biogen Idec / SOBI do not have well-established marketing/sales teams or good relationships with haematologists unlike global big pharma companies. CIO, CTO & Developer Resources  "Although several products for bleeding disorders are expected to be introduced in the next few years, most of them are being developed by current manufacturers," noted Chidambaram. "While the majority of companies strive to improve recombinant factor replacement based on novel technologies , very few companies are exploring completely different approaches to develop haemophilia therapies."  Global Haemophilia Therapeutics Market is part of the Life Sciences Growth Partnership Service program. Frost & Sullivan's related studies include: US Hematology Diagnostics Market, Product and Pipeline Assessment of the Global Orphan Drugs Market, A Competitive Analysis of the Global Breast Cancer Therapeutics Market, and A Product and Pipeline Analysis of the Opioid Therapeutics and Drug Delivery Market. All studies included in subscriptions provide detailed market opportunities and industry trends evaluated following extensive interviews with market participants.

NuLegacy Reports High Grade Iceberg Drilling Results!@#NuLegacy Reports High Grade Iceberg Drilling Results 0.8 Ounce Gold/Tonne Over 4.6 Meters in the North Zone May 7, 2015 04:33 AM EDT Blog This  RENO, NEVADA -- (Marketwired) -- 05/07/15 -- NuLegacy Gold Corporation (TSX VENTURE: NUG)(OTC PINK: NULGF) is pleased to report the assay results from the first six of the 24 holes planned for the US$1.3 million 2015 drilling program that will complete the earn-in to a 70% working interest in the expanding Iceberg Gold deposit, Elko County, Nevada.  Highlights: Please follow this link http://nulegacygold.com/s/2015-Drill-Program.asp to view plan map showing these holes in relation to prior drilling.  North zone - Hole RHB-040 has materially expanded the higher grade gold mineralization previously identified in the North zone of the Iceberg deposit. It intersected two gold bearing horizons one with a significantly high assay result of 25.2 grams of gold/tonne (0.8 troy ozs) over 4.6 meters within 41.2 meters (135ft.) of 3.9 grams/tonne that may represent the high grade horizon that we have been targeting. These results were verified by check-assays.  This long high-grade interval occurs in the Wenban stratigraphic unit that hosts the bulk of the higher grade material in Barrick's 15.5 million ounces Goldrush deposit(v) adjacent to the north-west of the Iceberg gold deposit(iv). The interval is in a silicified breccia, and is completely oxidized. This is the third and best hole to intersect this 'key' mineralized horizon in the North zone. We will be following up with a step-out from RHB-40 in the June series of holes.  "This result indicates the Iceberg gold deposit is a very robust Carlin-type gold system and significantly expands its exploration potential," said Alex Davidson, NuLegacy director and former head of global exploration for Barrick Gold Corporation.  Central zone - All three holes drilled in the Central zone returned impressive intervals of good grade gold mineralization.  RHB-41 & 42 (Central zone - north end) - both of these step-out holes were targeted to and intersected multiple and thick gold-bearing horizons thus confirming gold-horizon continuity and successfully expanding the Iceberg deposit's Central zone boundary to the north.  And the Central zone is confirmed to be wide open to the south as Hole RHB-43 (the most southerly of the three) returned a lengthy 51.8 meter interval (170 ft.) of 0.52 grams of gold/tonne in the Horse Canyon-Wenban8 contact zone directly under a "too shallow" historic drill hole. This opens the south extension of the Central zone for substantial expansion. Assay Details - Hole Iceberg From To Length Grade Horizon number zone (m) (m) (m) (ft.) (g/t) RHB-39 North 83.9 86.9 3.0 10 0.84 HC contact RHB-40 " 59.5 68.6 9.1 30 0.82 " and " 97.6 132.6 41.2 135 3.91 Wenban including " 118.9 131.1 12.2 40 10.95 " including 121.8 126.4 4.6 15 25.21 " RHB-41 Central 24.4 30.5 6.1 20 0.53 Volcaniclastics and " 48.8 56.4 7.6 25 0.52 " and " 96.0 132.6 36.6 120 0.55 HC Contact RHB-42 " 99.1 123.5 24.4 80 0.67 HC Contact including " 115.9 120.4 4.5 15 1.34 " RHB-43 Central 68.6 74.7 6.1 20 0.40 Volcaniclastics and " 97.6 149.4 51.8 170 0.52 HC Contact Including " 134.0 147.7 13.7 45 1.24 " RHB-44 South 44.2 45.7 1.5 5 1.13 Volcaniclastics  South zone - Hole RHB44 was a step-out to the east and while with a modest assay result it does confirm that the South zone has some lateral extent. With the limited drilling in the South zone to date geological studies are in progress to define additional drill targets.  Summary: The important aspects of these results are confirmation that: -- the Iceberg deposit hosts the classic Carlin-type very high-grade gold mineralization and, -- has significant quantities of gold in three gold-bearing stratigraphic horizons that are all within 200 meters of surface; the overlying older volcaniclastics (predominantly in the central and southern zone), the contact zone between the Horse Canyon and upper Wenban-8 formations (all three zones), and the middle Wenban5 limestone formation (more prevalent in the north zone).  "Our investment in the 7 core holes drilled last fall(i) is paying off, said Dr. Roger Steininger, 'as it greatly advanced our understanding of the stratigraphic controls and structural influences on the gold mineralization in the Iceberg deposit. This has improved our ability to target the higher grade breccia-hosted gold mineralization, which significantly is close enough to surface to have been oxidized as well." CIO, CTO & Developer Resources  The 2015 exploration program will total approximately 17.5 thousand feet (5,300 meters) of drilling through to the end of August 2015. The next set of six holes are being completed and assays are expected in early June.  Reverse circulation drilling is being conducted by Major Drilling of Salt Lake City, Utah under the supervision of David Mallo, Exploration Manager and Dr. Roger Steininger, COO (CPG 7417). Samples were analyzed by American Assay Labs of Sparks, NV. Sufficient commercially prepared standards, blanks, and duplicates were inserted to assure quality analytical results. Data verification of the analytical results included a statistical analysis of the duplicates, standards and blanks that must pass certain parameters for acceptance to ensure accurate and verifiable results. The reported gold intervals may or may not represent true thicknesses and/or widths as there is insufficient data at this time with respect to the shape of mineralization to calculate its true orientation.  About NuLegacy: NuLegacy Gold has discovered a classic Carlin-type oxidized gold deposit (the Iceberg) which as at end-2014 has an exploration target(ii) of 90 to 110 million tonnes grading between 0.90 gram and 1.10 gram of gold/tonne in the famed Cortez gold-trend of Nevada. The Iceberg is on a 60 sq. km portion of the Cortez optioned from Barrick Gold Corporation and is on trend with three of Barrick`s multi-million ounce Carlin-type systems that are its largest , lowest cost and politically safest gold deposits(iii) in the world. The Iceberg is adjacent(iv) to the third of these, the Goldrush deposit,(v) which is the most significant green-field discovery by a major gold producer in the past five years.  On Behalf Of NuLegacy Gold Corporation  James E Anderson, Chief Executive Officer  Dr. Roger Steininger, NuLegacy's chief operating officer is a Certified Professional Geologist (CPG 7417) and the qualified person as defined by NI 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects responsible for preparing and reviewing the scientific and technical information contained in this news release  Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.  This news release contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or future performance and reflect management's current expectations and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current beliefs and are based on assumptions made by and information currently available to the Company. Readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause future results to differ materially from those expected. There are no known resources or reserves in the Iceberg deposit and the proposed exploration programs are exploratory searches for commercial bodies of ore. In addition, the presence of gold deposits on properties adjacent or in close proximity to the Iceberg Deposit is not necessarily indicative of the gold mineralization on the Iceberg Deposit. All of the forward-looking statements made in this news release are qualified by these cautionary statements and those in our continuous disclosure filings available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com including our annual management's discussion and analysis dated July 25, 2014 for the year ended March 31, 2014. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise them to reflect new events or circumstances save as required under applicable securities legislation.  (i) Our investment was US$700,000 the favorable results of which were reported on Nov. 25, 2014 and Jan. 8, 2015.  (ii) These figures are conceptual in nature and derived from a compilation of 149 historic and 34 NuLegacy drill holes in and around the Iceberg deposit. To date, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.  (iii) As extracted from Barrick's Q4-2013 and Q1-2014 reports.  (iv) The close proximity of the Goldrush deposit to the Iceberg deposit is not necessarily indicative of the gold mineralization in the Iceberg deposit.  (v) As reported by Barrick as of December 31, 2013, the Goldrush deposit contained a resource of 423,000 ounce of gold (3.1 million tons grading 0.137 oz./ton - measured), 9,537,000 ounces (72.5 million tons grading 0.132 oz./ton - indicated) and 5,555,000 ounce (39.5 million tons grading 0.141oz./ton - inferred).

NuLegacy Reports High Grade Iceberg Drilling Results!@#NuLegacy Reports High Grade Iceberg Drilling Results 0.8 Ounce Gold/Tonne Over 4.6 Meters in the North Zone May 7, 2015 04:30 AM EDT Blog This  RENO, NEVADA -- (Marketwired) -- 05/07/15 -- NuLegacy Gold Corporation (TSX VENTURE:NUG)(OTC PINK:NULGF) is pleased to report the assay results from the first six of the 24 holes planned for the US$1.3 million 2015 drilling program that will complete the earn-in to a 70% working interest in the expanding Iceberg Gold deposit, Elko County, Nevada.  Highlights: Please follow this link http://nulegacygold.com/s/2015-Drill-Program.asp to view plan map showing these holes in relation to prior drilling.  North zone - Hole RHB-040 has materially expanded the higher grade gold mineralization previously identified in the North zone of the Iceberg deposit. It intersected two gold bearing horizons one with a significantly high assay result of 25.2 grams of gold/tonne (0.8 troy ozs) over 4.6 meters within 41.2 meters (135ft.) of 3.9 grams/tonne that may represent the high grade horizon that we have been targeting. These results were verified by check-assays.  This long high-grade interval occurs in the Wenban stratigraphic unit that hosts the bulk of the higher grade material in Barrick's 15.5 million ounces Goldrush deposit(v) adjacent to the north-west of the Iceberg gold deposit(iv). The interval is in a silicified breccia, and is completely oxidized. This is the third and best hole to intersect this 'key' mineralized horizon in the North zone. We will be following up with a step-out from RHB-40 in the June series of holes.  "This result indicates the Iceberg gold deposit is a very robust Carlin-type gold system and significantly expands its exploration potential," said Alex Davidson, NuLegacy director and former head of global exploration for Barrick Gold Corporation.  Central zone - All three holes drilled in the Central zone returned impressive intervals of good grade gold mineralization.  RHB-41 & 42 (Central zone - north end) - both of these step-out holes were targeted to and intersected multiple and thick gold-bearing horizons thus confirming gold-horizon continuity and successfully expanding the Iceberg deposit's Central zone boundary to the north.  And the Central zone is confirmed to be wide open to the south as Hole RHB-43 (the most southerly of the three) returned a lengthy 51.8 meter interval (170 ft.) of 0.52 grams of gold/tonne in the Horse Canyon-Wenban8 contact zone directly under a "too shallow" historic drill hole. This opens the south extension of the Central zone for substantial expansion. Assay Details - Hole Iceberg From To Length Grade Horizon number zone (m) (m) (m) (ft.) (g/t) RHB-39 North 83.9 86.9 3.0 10 0.84 HC contact RHB-40 " 59.5 68.6 9.1 30 0.82 " and " 97.6 132.6 41.2 135 3.91 Wenban including " 118.9 131.1 12.2 40 10.95 " including 121.8 126.4 4.6 15 25.21 " RHB-41 Central 24.4 30.5 6.1 20 0.53 Volcaniclastics and " 48.8 56.4 7.6 25 0.52 " and " 96.0 132.6 36.6 120 0.55 HC Contact RHB-42 " 99.1 123.5 24.4 80 0.67 HC Contact including " 115.9 120.4 4.5 15 1.34 " RHB-43 Central 68.6 74.7 6.1 20 0.40 Volcaniclastics and " 97.6 149.4 51.8 170 0.52 HC Contact Including " 134.0 147.7 13.7 45 1.24 " RHB-44 South 44.2 45.7 1.5 5 1.13 Volcaniclastics  South zone - Hole RHB44 was a step-out to the east and while with a modest assay result it does confirm that the South zone has some lateral extent. With the limited drilling in the South zone to date geological studies are in progress to define additional drill targets.  Summary: The important aspects of these results are confirmation that: -- the Iceberg deposit hosts the classic Carlin-type very high-grade gold mineralization and, -- has significant quantities of gold in three gold-bearing stratigraphic horizons that are all within 200 meters of surface; the overlying older volcaniclastics (predominantly in the central and southern zone), the contact zone between the Horse Canyon and upper Wenban-8 formations (all three zones), and the middle Wenban5 limestone formation (more prevalent in the north zone). CIO, CTO & Developer Resources  "Our investment in the 7 core holes drilled last fall(i) is paying off, said Dr. Roger Steininger, 'as it greatly advanced our understanding of the stratigraphic controls and structural influences on the gold mineralization in the Iceberg deposit. This has improved our ability to target the higher grade breccia-hosted gold mineralization, which significantly is close enough to surface to have been oxidized as well."  The 2015 exploration program will total approximately 17.5 thousand feet (5,300 meters) of drilling through to the end of August 2015. The next set of six holes are being completed and assays are expected in early June.  Reverse circulation drilling is being conducted by Major Drilling of Salt Lake City, Utah under the supervision of David Mallo, Exploration Manager and Dr. Roger Steininger, COO (CPG 7417). Samples were analyzed by American Assay Labs of Sparks, NV. Sufficient commercially prepared standards, blanks, and duplicates were inserted to assure quality analytical results. Data verification of the analytical results included a statistical analysis of the duplicates, standards and blanks that must pass certain parameters for acceptance to ensure accurate and verifiable results. The reported gold intervals may or may not represent true thicknesses and/or widths as there is insufficient data at this time with respect to the shape of mineralization to calculate its true orientation.  About NuLegacy: NuLegacy Gold has discovered a classic Carlin-type oxidized gold deposit (the Iceberg) which as at end-2014 has an exploration target(ii) of 90 to 110 million tonnes grading between 0.90 gram and 1.10 gram of gold/tonne in the famed Cortez gold-trend of Nevada. The Iceberg is on a 60 sq. km portion of the Cortez optioned from Barrick Gold Corporation and is on trend with three of Barrick`s multi-million ounce Carlin-type systems that are its largest , lowest cost and politically safest gold deposits(iii) in the world. The Iceberg is adjacent(iv) to the third of these, the Goldrush deposit,(v) which is the most significant green-field discovery by a major gold producer in the past five years.  On Behalf Of NuLegacy Gold Corporation  James E Anderson, Chief Executive Officer  Dr. Roger Steininger, NuLegacy's chief operating officer is a Certified Professional Geologist (CPG 7417) and the qualified person as defined by NI 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects responsible for preparing and reviewing the scientific and technical information contained in this news release  Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.  This news release contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or future performance and reflect management's current expectations and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current beliefs and are based on assumptions made by and information currently available to the Company. Readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause future results to differ materially from those expected. There are no known resources or reserves in the Iceberg deposit and the proposed exploration programs are exploratory searches for commercial bodies of ore. In addition, the presence of gold deposits on properties adjacent or in close proximity to the Iceberg Deposit is not necessarily indicative of the gold mineralization on the Iceberg Deposit. All of the forward-looking statements made in this news release are qualified by these cautionary statements and those in our continuous disclosure filings available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com including our annual management's discussion and analysis dated July 25, 2014 for the year ended March 31, 2014. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise them to reflect new events or circumstances save as required under applicable securities legislation.  (i) Our investment was US$700,000 the favorable results of which were reported on Nov. 25, 2014 and Jan. 8, 2015.  (ii) These figures are conceptual in nature and derived from a compilation of 149 historic and 34 NuLegacy drill holes in and around the Iceberg deposit. To date, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.  (iii) As extracted from Barrick's Q4-2013 and Q1-2014 reports.  (iv) The close proximity of the Goldrush deposit to the Iceberg deposit is not necessarily indicative of the gold mineralization in the Iceberg deposit.  (v) As reported by Barrick as of December 31, 2013, the Goldrush deposit contained a resource of 423,000 ounce of gold (3.1 million tons grading 0.137 oz./ton - measured), 9,537,000 ounces (72.5 million tons grading 0.132 oz./ton - indicated) and 5,555,000 ounce (39.5 million tons grading 0.141oz./ton - inferred).

Developers wrote code, operations provisioned and maintained infrastructure, and security found holes and worried about all the vulnerabilities they knew hadn't been fixed yet. This separation of knowledge, however, created inefficiencies. Problems that would have been cheap to ...

Creating digital technologies for dementia care!@#Home | Brain and Nerves | Brain Diseases | Dementia | Creating digital technologies for dementia care Creating digital technologies for dementia care 24 minutes ago Designers, coders, hackers and researchers are coming together for an event aimed at exploring how digital technologies could support and improve dementia care. Supporting dementia care Create-4-Dementia, from 30th to 31st May 2015, is the first public event of the Social Computing and Mental Health Research Network led by the University of Lincoln, UK, and funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).People working in digital design and/or healthcare are invited to register for the event, with the two-day hackathon culminating in the creation of digital prototypes.Network leader Professor Shaun Lawson, from the School of Computer Science at the University of Lincoln, said: “The design of technology to address issues around dementia has received a lot of attention, but it remains a very difficult and sensitive area. At this event we want to draw in people with any and all relevant skillsets so that everyone's voice is heard – in particular we want to see if we can rethink entire aspects of the approach to designing for dementia.”The Social Computing and Mental Health Research Network was created to address challenges around creating online mental health services that could offer a more compelling and convenient way to access information, therapy and support.The network, which is conducted in partnership with Newcastle University School of Computing Science in collaboration with NIHR MindTech Healthcare Technology Co-operative at Nottingham, aims to create a new interdisciplinary research community, by developing interaction between science, technology, clinical and commercial groups and charities. Experts in a number of fields, such as social computing and human computer interaction, are working together to try and understand what the challenges are in using mobile and web applications, as well as social media, to assist people with mental health problems and create new collaborative multidisciplinary research proposals. On the Create-4-Dementia event, Dr Michael Craven, Senior Research Fellow with MindTech and the University of Nottingham Faculty of Engineering, and member of the Centre for Dementia, said: “This is a great opportunity for engineers and software designers to engage with unmet needs in dementia and begin to formulate technology solutions.”Teams will compete for juried prizes to the value of £1,000 and can apply for additional research funding of up to £10,000. For more information and to register for the event, which is taking place at the Great Northern Museum in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, visit http://create4dementia.com/apply . Deadline for entry is 14th May 2015.!@#english

Software Is Eating the World Download slides ▸ Here  Companies that were not previously in the technology space now find themselves competing with Google and Amazon on the speed of innovation. As the innovation cycle accelerates, companies must embrace rapid and constant change to both applications and their infrastructure, and find a way to deliver speed and agility of development without sacrificing reliability or efficiency of operations. In her Keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell, discussed how IT organizations can automate just-in-time assembly of application environments - each built for a specific purpose with the right infrastructure, components, service, data and tools - and deliver this automation to developers as a self-service. Victoria's keynote included remarks by Kira Makagon, EVP of Innovation at RingCentral, and Ratnakar Lavu, EVP of Digital Technology at Kohl's.  DevOps Summit Was a Terrific Event! ▸ Here  NoOps != No Operations Download slides ▸ Here  Shipping daily, injecting faults, and keeping an extremely high availability "without Ops"? Understand why NoOps does not mean no operations. Agile development methodologies require evolved operations to be successful.  In his keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, David Tesar, Microsoft Technical Evangelist on Microsoft Azure and DevOps, discussed how Microsoft teams that have made huge progress with a DevOps transformation effectively utilize operations staff and how challenges were overcome. Regardless of whether you are a startup or a mature enterprise, whether you are using PaaS, Micro Services, or Containerization, walk away with some practical tips where Ops can make a significant impact working with the development teams. Operational teams and functions are increasingly more important as the industry delivers software at a blazing pace.  DevOps Is Even More Important Than You Think The move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has added significant pace to the application development and deployment environment. When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time frames that were unimaginable a few years ago. The consequent move toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the development and operations sides to work very closely together. Thus, DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today.  This Lunchtime Power Panel at DevOps Summit was moderated by Andi Mann, VP of Strategic Solutions at CA Technologies. Monish Sharma, VP of Customer Success at ElasticBox; Myles Steinhauser, Software Development Engineer at Blue Box; Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell Inc.; and Mark Levy, Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Serena Software go beyond the basics in a discussion of why DevOps is not only important for transformation, but is mission-critical for enterprises that want to stay in business.  DevOps: Disruptive but Essential in a Cloud Expo ® Universe The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.  The DevOps Summit 2015 New York and Silicon Valley will be held:  DevOps Summit 2015 New York (June 9-11, 2015, at the Javits Center, Manhattan)  DevOps Summit 2015 Silicon Valley (November 3-5, 2015, at the Santa Clara Convention Center)  DevOps Summit, June 9-11, 2015, at the New York Javits Center in the heart of world's financial capital, will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of time enterprise IT professionals spend putting out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.  DevOps Summit content doubled in November from a single track last year in New York to two simultaneous tracks: "Dev" Developer Focus and "Ops" Operations Focus ,as well as high impact keynotes attended by over 1,000 delegates.

Announcing @Site24x7 to Exhibit at @CloudExpo New York [#Cloud #DevOps]!@#Announcing @Site24x7 to Exhibit at @CloudExpo New York [#Cloud #DevOps] Site24x7 helps monitor the uptime and performance of websites, online applications and servers May 7, 2015 05:00 AM EDT Reads: Blog This  SYS-CON Events announced today that Site24x7 , the cloud infrastructure monitoring service, will exhibit at SYS-CON's 16th International Cloud Expo ®, which will take place on June 9-11, 2015, at the Javits Center in New York City, NY.  Site24x7 is a cloud infrastructure monitoring service that helps monitor the uptime and performance of websites, online applications, servers, mobile websites and custom APIs. The monitoring is done from 50+ locations across the world and from various wireless carriers, thus providing a global perspective of the end-user experience. Site24x7 supports monitoring HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, TCP, IMAP, SSL, Ping, FTP, SFTP, DNS and other Internet-facing network services.  For more information on Site24x7, please visit www.site24x7.com .  Software Is Eating the World Download slides ▸ Here  Companies that were not previously in the technology space now find themselves competing with Google and Amazon on the speed of innovation. As the innovation cycle accelerates, companies must embrace rapid and constant change to both applications and their infrastructure, and find a way to deliver speed and agility of development without sacrificing reliability or efficiency of operations. In her Keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell, discussed how IT organizations can automate just-in-time assembly of application environments - each built for a specific purpose with the right infrastructure, components, service, data and tools - and deliver this automation to developers as a self-service. Victoria's keynote included remarks by Kira Makagon, EVP of Innovation at RingCentral, and Ratnakar Lavu, EVP of Digital Technology at Kohl's.  DevOps Summit Was a Terrific Event! ▸ Here  NoOps != No Operations Download slides ▸ Here  Shipping daily, injecting faults, and keeping an extremely high availability "without Ops"? Understand why NoOps does not mean no operations. Agile development methodologies require evolved operations to be successful.  In his keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, David Tesar, Microsoft Technical Evangelist on Microsoft Azure and DevOps, discussed how Microsoft teams that have made huge progress with a DevOps transformation effectively utilize operations staff and how challenges were overcome. Regardless of whether you are a startup or a mature enterprise, whether you are using PaaS, Micro Services, or Containerization, walk away with some practical tips where Ops can make a significant impact working with the development teams. Operational teams and functions are increasingly more important as the industry delivers software at a blazing pace.  DevOps Is Even More Important Than You Think The move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has added significant pace to the application development and deployment environment. When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time frames that were unimaginable a few years ago. The consequent move toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the development and operations sides to work very closely together. Thus, DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today.  This Lunchtime Power Panel at DevOps Summit was moderated by Andi Mann, VP of Strategic Solutions at CA Technologies. Monish Sharma, VP of Customer Success at ElasticBox; Myles Steinhauser, Software Development Engineer at Blue Box; Victoria Livschitz, CEO of Qubell Inc.; and Mark Levy, Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Serena Software go beyond the basics in a discussion of why DevOps is not only important for transformation, but is mission-critical for enterprises that want to stay in business.  DevOps: Disruptive but Essential in a Cloud Expo ® Universe The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.  The DevOps Summit 2015 New York and Silicon Valley will be held:  DevOps Summit 2015 New York (June 9-11, 2015, at the Javits Center, Manhattan)  DevOps Summit 2015 Silicon Valley (November 3-5, 2015, at the Santa Clara Convention Center)  DevOps Summit, June 9-11, 2015, at the New York Javits Center in the heart of world's financial capital, will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of time enterprise IT professionals spend putting out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.
