The markets had it coming!@#A 723-point, or 2.63%, fall in the Sensex to its lowest point this year may seem like a sharp and sudden fall, but Indian equities had it coming for quite some time now. The difficulties being faced by the new government and the lack of traction in company earnings are increasingly showing up in the market’s dips. Local equities are the worst performing major market this year, as is evident from chart 1. The Modi magic is fading from the markets. A major concern is that despite the new GDP (gross domestic product) numbers promising a wonderful year, demand continues to remain soft indicating that expectations from the change of guard at the centre are waning. The HSBC India Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index shows that private sector activity fell to a six-month low of 52.5 in April as both manufacturing and services sector recovery is yet to find a firm footing. What’s worse, companies are shedding jobs. In the past six months, the Sensex has fallen 6 % following the trend in the Composite PMI, as the chart 2 shows. Markets rise or fall based on new information and they are increasingly discounting the prospects of a stimulus in China and a less moribund future for Europe. In contrast, after the initial euphoria in India, markets have come to face a more sober reality. While there is no danger of an immediate oil shock, crude oil prices have also gained over 40% since their lows of last year. Foreign institutional investors, who were gung-ho on India not too long ago, have become bearish owing to lack of recovery in economic fundamentals. A tax row with the government over the retrospective levy of minimum alternate tax has only increased their dislike for Indian stocks. They have sold around Rs. 12,661 crore since mid-April, according to data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India. This number doesn’t include Daiichi Sankyo’s sale of its Sun Pharma stake. “When the market falls like a knife, no one wants to catch it,” said Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst. A continued fall may have spurred those investors who funded their share purchases with margin money to sell, making it a vicious cycle. Secondly, as Prime Database numbers show, cash-strapped promoters of Indian firms continue to pledge more shares. At the end of the last fiscal year, promoter pledging for 495 NSE-listed companies rose to Rs. 1.94 trillion, or 43% of their holdings. In a falling market, people who hold these shares as collateral may sell to maintain margins, which leads to a further fall in prices. With the Met department predicting a below-normal monsoon and no signs of revival of private sector capital expenditure, there is no trigger for the markets to rise. There is nothing in the legislative agenda that increases optimism either. The land acquisition and real estate bill are still stuck. Although, the goods and services tax bill cleared the Lok Sabha, its real test will be in the upper house where the government is a minority. “There is no likelihood of capex by the private sector over the next one year. The selling will continue until such negative sentiment prevails and there is going to be more pain between now and Diwali,” said Saurabh Mukherjea, head of institutional equities at Ambit Capital Pvt Ltd.​!@#english
He stands to lose it all: Verdict in hit-and-run case puts brand Salman in grave danger - Firstpost!@#Print this Article  Just a few months ago Salman Khan made headlines for all the right reasons: He made it to the top of Forbes India Celebrity 100 List , claiming the throne from two-time list topper Shah Rukh Khan, earned a whopping Rs 244.5 crore last year and topped both the fame and earnings rank. Brand Salman was at its peak.  Today, though, there is a twist in the tale. With the Mumbai sessions court verdict sentencing him to five years in prison for the 2002 hit-and-run case when he drove an SUV onto a pavement in Mumbai, killing one person, brand Salman is in grave danger.  With more than 10 brands that he endorses and two upcoming movies (Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and Bajrangi Bhaijan ), about Rs 250 crore ride on brand Salman. Although he has received an interim bail for two days before he goes to prison, what remains to be seen is how this court verdict changes his career trajectory. If one goes by what happened with his friend and co-star Sanjay Dutt when he went behind bars, this is certainly not good news. He stands to lose it all.  Harish Bijoor, CEO at Harish Bijoor Consults Inc, says there are three brand entities around Salman Khan: First is brand Salman himself, second is the brand Being Human created and promoted by him, while the third is the series of brands he endorses. According to Bijoor, the verdict will affect each of these brands differently.  “To the first it will mean an erosion of personal equity and integrity quotient. His hero status of being a clean and a straight-forward person gets affected. For the brand Being Human it shouldn’t make any difference at all. It is the only brand that will continue his endorsement, and convey the softer side of Salman Khan. In fact, it will be a revival vehicle for the brand Salman Khan,” says Bijoor. So the brand Khan helped create will, in turn, help resuscitate his own brand equity if he serves the five year sentence, believes Bijoor. Salman Khan. AFP.  When Khan spoke to us in December, he agreed with this. Being Human, Khan says, is as big as he is. Actually, if this current dream run of success is being attributed to his work with the foundation, and if, in effect, it was the foundation that lifted him, surely it was even bigger than him? Besides, that’s what all the brand extensions and expansions are for: To ensure that the money keeps coming in, and that Being Human outlives him.  On the commercial brands that Khan endorses, Bijoor says, “Most brands are fickle; they support only positive sentiments. So I suspect they will withdraw. They have already benefited from the upside; soon they will stop airing his endorsements.”  The stock market has already reacted by pushing down prices of Eros International by 5 percent, while shares of Mandhana Industries are down by 4 percent. Eros has recently acquired global distribution rights for two of Khan's upcoming movies, while Mandhana Industries has the mandate to design and distribute the Being Human clothing range.  What we wrote in December 2014 about Being Human highlights the importance and risk his favourite brand carries today if his fans fall out of favour and stop buying its merchandise:  Being Human started life as a T-shirt. It is now a clothing brand, sold in 14 countries, with 30 standalone stores and 160 shop-in-shop outlets in India; abroad, there are 80 shop-in-shops in GCC countries and 55 in Europe. (Licensee Mandhana Industries makes, distributes and markets its products; Khan oversees design and communication.) It is now expanding into a lifestyle brand, with fragrances, watches, gym equipment, and other products. In 2013-14, the license brought Rs 132 crore; all of Khan's share it goes to Being Human, the charitable trust he set up in 2007, and to which he has assigned the brand in perpetuity. It has, since then, disbursed over Rs 32.5 crore through its health care and education projects.  All this comes to nought if brand Salman Khan gets affected by the prolonged jail sentence. His movie revenues, the brands he endorses or the foundation he runs entirely depend on one entity—him. With him behind bars, all the work comes to a grinding halt and many more producers who had lined up projects with him, but haven’t begun shooting, might need to replace him rather than wait for five years.  Bollywood, though, has rallied behind him and have been tweeting in his favour. From his protégé Arjun Kapoor to co-star Sonakshi Sinha, singer Mika singh to actors Rishi Kapoor, Riteish Deshmukh, Bipasha Basu and even Alia Bhatt— all have expressed shock on the verdict and sympathy for Khan.  One of the most bankable Bollywood stars, who has proved his mettle time and again at the box-office in the past few years, he has lined up some big releases in the next few years. Here are some that have been announced:  a) Bajrangi Bhaijaan : To be directed by Kabir Khan whose earlier film Ek Tha Tiger earned more than Rs 200 crore. Bajrangi Bhaijaan has been scheduled to release on Eid this year. Khan was shooting for this film at Srinagar and had to fly back to Mumbai for the court verdict today.  b) Prem Ratan Dhan Payo : After many years, Salman has once again teamed up with Sooraj Barjatya and the film was slated to release on Diwali. Khan plays a double role in this movie after many years. He last did a double role for Judwaa (1997), which was a hit.  c) Shuddhi: This is a film by Karan Johar and has already seen many changes in its star cast. Earlier Hrithik Roshan was supposed to act in it, then finally Khan agreed and it would have been the first lead star movie of Khan with Johar. But no one knows its fate now.  Two other films that had been lined up but production was yet to begin are No Entry Mein Entry and Yash Raj Films’ Sultan to be directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, where Khan plays a boxer.  A few months ago when we met Khan, he shared this about his bad boy image: “I’m still the bad boy. But to the bad people. I’m no saint, dude. I party. I party like hell when I want to. I still do that, but I come back, to this.” The gesture encompassed both his acting and the charitable foundation.  The movie producers who bet on him and brands that opted for his endorsement would be pinning their hopes on his comeback. !@#english

Kishore Biyani's Big Bazaar to launch app next month, to take on e-tailers and offer instant credits - The Times of India!@#ApnaCircle In the past two years, Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal and others have been offering lower prices to lure consumers, hurting organised retailers. NEW DELHI: Kishore Biyani is taking the discount battle to the enemy. Big Bazaar will go live next month with an app to combat the rapid adoption of ecommerce in India to try and beat online retailers at a price-cutting strategy that brick-and-mortar stores have been struggling to come to terms with. "We are launching a price-match offer where if you shop from us and anybody else is selling cheaper than us at that moment, we will automatically give credits in your account — anything online or offline," Biyani said in an interview. Apart from this, Biyani's Future Group is also seeking to harness its presence on the ground to complement its push to counter online retail. In the past two years, Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal and others have been offering lower prices to lure consumers, hurting organised retailers, already feeling the squeeze of an economic slowdown. Flush with funding, ecommerce firms have the kind of cash needed to persist with this strategy. E-tailers may have shelled out discounts worth hundreds of millions of dollars around Diwali alone, according to the trade. Amazon has just launched a Summer Sale, offering "deals that'll make you dance". Biyani , who's just struck a deal to take over Bharti Retail, said he doesn't worry too much about ecommerce, because it won't be able to match real-world stores in terms of overall volume. "Who is afraid of ecommerce?" Biyani asked. "Even if you open 10 sites in 10 years, it will be 10% (of the total organised retail market). Secondly, worldwide, multichannel is the way. Traditional retailers doing multichannel is a bigger thing than pure online in any which way." Big Bazaar, a hypermarket that sell brands across categories from smartphones, electronics and furniture to grocery and general merchandise, is testing the app that will let consumers compare prices offered by online and other offline retailers. Customers will have a week from the date of purchase to make the price comparison. Apart from this, Future will soon conduct an omni-channel pilot programme in which its Big Bazaar and Food Bazaar stores will deliver goods to customers in Mumbai an hour after they place their orders. The price comparison app is currently being tested by Future Group employees at the Food Bazaar store in Vikhroli in Mumbai. The so-called FutureOfMarketing initiative "will give customers the confidence to shop at Big Bazaar without worrying if any competition is advertising products cheaper than us," said an internal e-mail sent to Future Group employees. The app, which will be available for public use in Mumbai in the coming weeks, will go nationwide in the coming months. Future's acquisition of Bharti Retail in an all stock deal valued the latter at Rs 500 crore. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Recombinant and Prophylactic Treatments Boost Global Haemophilia Therapeutics Market!@#Recombinant and Prophylactic Treatments Boost Global Haemophilia Therapeutics Market Haemophilia B segment will see high growth over the forecast period, finds Frost & Sullivan May 7, 2015 04:45 AM EDT Blog This  LONDON , May 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Increased uptake of recombinant therapies and prophylactic use , coupled with improved diagnosis of haemophilia, is expected to drive the associated therapeutics market. Recombinant therapies are likely to command a premium price and fuel growth in developed markets, while heightened access to treatment and larger patient volumes due to more funding for critical care are anticipated to contribute to demand in emerging markets.  Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150507/214499LOGO  New analysis from Frost & Sullivan, Global Haemophilia Therapeutics Market , finds that the market earned revenues of $9.98 billion in 2014 and estimates this to reach $13.43 billion in 2019 . The study covers haemophilia A and Von Willebrand disease (factor VIII/von Willebrand factor), haemophilia B (factor IX), inhibitors (factor VIIa), and novel therapies in the pipeline.  For complimentary access to more information on this research, please visit: http://corpcom.frost.com/forms/EU_PR_AZanchi_MAD9-52_30Apr15 .  Currently, plasma-derived therapies account for nearly 30 percent of haemophilia A therapeutics sales, 41 percent of haemophilia B therapeutics sales, and 25 percent of the inhibitors market. Over time, however, adults are likely to switch to prophylaxis therapies due to the lucrative benefits offered by these long-lasting products compared to plasma-derived products.  "The haemophilia B segment is set to gain traction as newer products are far more convenient than established therapies," said Frost & Sullivan Healthcare Industry Analyst Aiswariya Chidambaram . "In contrast, the haemophilia A segment could lose some pace, with none of the recently launched or pipeline FVIII therapies able to extend product half-life by more than 60 percent."  With several new recombinant products in the market, a rise in price pressure is anticipated. This, along with negotiated discounts in emerging markets, could hamper the development of the global haemophilia therapeutics market.  Newer recombinant therapies will gradually capture share from leading players, posing more of a long-term threat to the market. This is because market entrants such as Biogen Idec / SOBI do not have well-established marketing/sales teams or good relationships with haematologists unlike global big pharma companies. CIO, CTO & Developer Resources  "Although several products for bleeding disorders are expected to be introduced in the next few years, most of them are being developed by current manufacturers," noted Chidambaram. "While the majority of companies strive to improve recombinant factor replacement based on novel technologies , very few companies are exploring completely different approaches to develop haemophilia therapies."  Global Haemophilia Therapeutics Market is part of the Life Sciences Growth Partnership Service program. Frost & Sullivan's related studies include: US Hematology Diagnostics Market, Product and Pipeline Assessment of the Global Orphan Drugs Market, A Competitive Analysis of the Global Breast Cancer Therapeutics Market, and A Product and Pipeline Analysis of the Opioid Therapeutics and Drug Delivery Market.

NuLegacy Reports High Grade Iceberg Drilling Results!@#NuLegacy Reports High Grade Iceberg Drilling Results 0.8 Ounce Gold/Tonne Over 4.6 Meters in the North Zone May 7, 2015 04:33 AM EDT Blog This  RENO, NEVADA -- (Marketwired) -- 05/07/15 -- NuLegacy Gold Corporation (TSX VENTURE: NUG)(OTC PINK: NULGF) is pleased to report the assay results from the first six of the 24 holes planned for the US$1.3 million 2015 drilling program that will complete the earn-in to a 70% working interest in the expanding Iceberg Gold deposit, Elko County, Nevada.  Highlights: Please follow this link http://nulegacygold.com/s/2015-Drill-Program.asp to view plan map showing these holes in relation to prior drilling.  North zone - Hole RHB-040 has materially expanded the higher grade gold mineralization previously identified in the North zone of the Iceberg deposit. It intersected two gold bearing horizons one with a significantly high assay result of 25.2 grams of gold/tonne (0.8 troy ozs) over 4.6 meters within 41.2 meters (135ft.) of 3.9 grams/tonne that may represent the high grade horizon that we have been targeting. These results were verified by check-assays.  This long high-grade interval occurs in the Wenban stratigraphic unit that hosts the bulk of the higher grade material in Barrick's 15.5 million ounces Goldrush deposit(v) adjacent to the north-west of the Iceberg gold deposit(iv). The interval is in a silicified breccia, and is completely oxidized. This is the third and best hole to intersect this 'key' mineralized horizon in the North zone. We will be following up with a step-out from RHB-40 in the June series of holes.  "This result indicates the Iceberg gold deposit is a very robust Carlin-type gold system and significantly expands its exploration potential," said Alex Davidson, NuLegacy director and former head of global exploration for Barrick Gold Corporation.  Central zone - All three holes drilled in the Central zone returned impressive intervals of good grade gold mineralization.  RHB-41 & 42 (Central zone - north end) - both of these step-out holes were targeted to and intersected multiple and thick gold-bearing horizons thus confirming gold-horizon continuity and successfully expanding the Iceberg deposit's Central zone boundary to the north.  And the Central zone is confirmed to be wide open to the south as Hole RHB-43 (the most southerly of the three) returned a lengthy 51.8 meter interval (170 ft.) of 0.52 grams of gold/tonne in the Horse Canyon-Wenban8 contact zone directly under a "too shallow" historic drill hole. This opens the south extension of the Central zone for substantial expansion. Assay Details - Hole Iceberg From To Length Grade Horizon number zone (m) (m) (m) (ft.) (g/t) RHB-39 North 83.9 86.9 3.0 10 0.84 HC contact RHB-40 " 59.5 68.6 9.1 30 0.82 " and " 97.6 132.6 41.2 135 3.91 Wenban including " 118.9 131.1 12.2 40 10.95 " including 121.8 126.4 4.6 15 25.21 " RHB-41 Central 24.4 30.5 6.1 20 0.53 Volcaniclastics and " 48.8 56.4 7.6 25 0.52 " and " 96.0 132.6 36.6 120 0.55 HC Contact RHB-42 " 99.1 123.5 24.4 80 0.67 HC Contact including " 115.9 120.4 4.5 15 1.34 " RHB-43 Central 68.6 74.7 6.1 20 0.40 Volcaniclastics and " 97.6 149.4 51.8 170 0.52 HC Contact Including " 134.0 147.7 13.7 45 1.24 " RHB-44 South 44.2 45.7 1.5 5 1.13 Volcaniclastics  South zone - Hole RHB44 was a step-out to the east and while with a modest assay result it does confirm that the South zone has some lateral extent. With the limited drilling in the South zone to date geological studies are in progress to define additional drill targets.  Summary: The important aspects of these results are confirmation that: -- the Iceberg deposit hosts the classic Carlin-type very high-grade gold mineralization and, -- has significant quantities of gold in three gold-bearing stratigraphic horizons that are all within 200 meters of surface; the overlying older volcaniclastics (predominantly in the central and southern zone), the contact zone between the Horse Canyon and upper Wenban-8 formations (all three zones), and the middle Wenban5 limestone formation (more prevalent in the north zone).  "Our investment in the 7 core holes drilled last fall(i) is paying off, said Dr. Roger Steininger, 'as it greatly advanced our understanding of the stratigraphic controls and structural influences on the gold mineralization in the Iceberg deposit. This has improved our ability to target the higher grade breccia-hosted gold mineralization, which significantly is close enough to surface to have been oxidized as well." CIO, CTO & Developer Resources  The 2015 exploration program will total approximately 17.5 thousand feet (5,300 meters) of drilling through to the end of August 2015. The next set of six holes are being completed and assays are expected in early June.  Reverse circulation drilling is being conducted by Major Drilling of Salt Lake City, Utah under the supervision of David Mallo, Exploration Manager and Dr. Roger Steininger, COO (CPG 7417). Samples were analyzed by American Assay Labs of Sparks, NV. Sufficient commercially prepared standards, blanks, and duplicates were inserted to assure quality analytical results. Data verification of the analytical results included a statistical analysis of the duplicates, standards and blanks that must pass certain parameters for acceptance to ensure accurate and verifiable results. The reported gold intervals may or may not represent true thicknesses and/or widths as there is insufficient data at this time with respect to the shape of mineralization to calculate its true orientation.  About NuLegacy: NuLegacy Gold has discovered a classic Carlin-type oxidized gold deposit (the Iceberg) which as at end-2014 has an exploration target(ii) of 90 to 110 million tonnes grading between 0.90 gram and 1.10 gram of gold/tonne in the famed Cortez gold-trend of Nevada. The Iceberg is on a 60 sq. km portion of the Cortez optioned from Barrick Gold Corporation and is on trend with three of Barrick`s multi-million ounce Carlin-type systems that are its largest , lowest cost and politically safest gold deposits(iii) in the world. The Iceberg is adjacent(iv) to the third of these, the Goldrush deposit,(v) which is the most significant green-field discovery by a major gold producer in the past five years.  On Behalf Of NuLegacy Gold Corporation  James E Anderson, Chief Executive Officer  Dr. Roger Steininger, NuLegacy's chief operating officer is a Certified Professional Geologist (CPG 7417) and the qualified person as defined by NI 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects responsible for preparing and reviewing the scientific and technical information contained in this news release  Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.  This news release contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or future performance and reflect management's current expectations and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current beliefs and are based on assumptions made by and information currently available to the Company. Readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause future results to differ materially from those expected. There are no known resources or reserves in the Iceberg deposit and the proposed exploration programs are exploratory searches for commercial bodies of ore. In addition, the presence of gold deposits on properties adjacent or in close proximity to the Iceberg Deposit is not necessarily indicative of the gold mineralization on the Iceberg Deposit. All of the forward-looking statements made in this news release are qualified by these cautionary statements and those in our continuous disclosure filings available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com including our annual management's discussion and analysis dated July 25, 2014 for the year ended March 31, 2014. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise them to reflect new events or circumstances save as required under applicable securities legislation.  (i) Our investment was US$700,000 the favorable results of which were reported on Nov. 25, 2014 and Jan. 8, 2015.  (ii) These figures are conceptual in nature and derived from a compilation of 149 historic and 34 NuLegacy drill holes in and around the Iceberg deposit. To date, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.  (iii) As extracted from Barrick's Q4-2013 and Q1-2014 reports.  (iv) The close proximity of the Goldrush deposit to the Iceberg deposit is not necessarily indicative of the gold mineralization in the Iceberg deposit.  (v) As reported by Barrick as of December 31, 2013, the Goldrush deposit contained a resource of 423,000 ounce of gold (3.1 million tons grading 0.137 oz./ton - measured), 9,537,000 ounces (72.5 million tons grading 0.132 oz./ton - indicated) and 5,555,000 ounce (39.5 million tons grading 0.141oz./ton - inferred).

NuLegacy Reports High Grade Iceberg Drilling Results!@#NuLegacy Reports High Grade Iceberg Drilling Results 0.8 Ounce Gold/Tonne Over 4.6 Meters in the North Zone May 7, 2015 04:30 AM EDT Blog This  RENO, NEVADA -- (Marketwired) -- 05/07/15 -- NuLegacy Gold Corporation (TSX VENTURE:NUG)(OTC PINK:NULGF) is pleased to report the assay results from the first six of the 24 holes planned for the US$1.3 million 2015 drilling program that will complete the earn-in to a 70% working interest in the expanding Iceberg Gold deposit, Elko County, Nevada.  Highlights: Please follow this link http://nulegacygold.com/s/2015-Drill-Program.asp to view plan map showing these holes in relation to prior drilling.  North zone - Hole RHB-040 has materially expanded the higher grade gold mineralization previously identified in the North zone of the Iceberg deposit. It intersected two gold bearing horizons one with a significantly high assay result of 25.2 grams of gold/tonne (0.8 troy ozs) over 4.6 meters within 41.2 meters (135ft.) of 3.9 grams/tonne that may represent the high grade horizon that we have been targeting. These results were verified by check-assays.  This long high-grade interval occurs in the Wenban stratigraphic unit that hosts the bulk of the higher grade material in Barrick's 15.5 million ounces Goldrush deposit(v) adjacent to the north-west of the Iceberg gold deposit(iv). The interval is in a silicified breccia, and is completely oxidized. This is the third and best hole to intersect this 'key' mineralized horizon in the North zone. We will be following up with a step-out from RHB-40 in the June series of holes.  "This result indicates the Iceberg gold deposit is a very robust Carlin-type gold system and significantly expands its exploration potential," said Alex Davidson, NuLegacy director and former head of global exploration for Barrick Gold Corporation.  Central zone - All three holes drilled in the Central zone returned impressive intervals of good grade gold mineralization.  RHB-41 & 42 (Central zone - north end) - both of these step-out holes were targeted to and intersected multiple and thick gold-bearing horizons thus confirming gold-horizon continuity and successfully expanding the Iceberg deposit's Central zone boundary to the north.  And the Central zone is confirmed to be wide open to the south as Hole RHB-43 (the most southerly of the three) returned a lengthy 51.8 meter interval (170 ft.) of 0.52 grams of gold/tonne in the Horse Canyon-Wenban8 contact zone directly under a "too shallow" historic drill hole. This opens the south extension of the Central zone for substantial expansion. Assay Details - Hole Iceberg From To Length Grade Horizon number zone (m) (m) (m) (ft.) (g/t) RHB-39 North 83.9 86.9 3.0 10 0.84 HC contact RHB-40 " 59.5 68.6 9.1 30 0.82 " and " 97.6 132.6 41.2 135 3.91 Wenban including " 118.9 131.1 12.2 40 10.95 " including 121.8 126.4 4.6 15 25.21 " RHB-41 Central 24.4 30.5 6.1 20 0.53 Volcaniclastics and " 48.8 56.4 7.6 25 0.52 " and " 96.0 132.6 36.6 120 0.55 HC Contact RHB-42 " 99.1 123.5 24.4 80 0.67 HC Contact including " 115.9 120.4 4.5 15 1.34 " RHB-43 Central 68.6 74.7 6.1 20 0.40 Volcaniclastics and " 97.6 149.4 51.8 170 0.52 HC Contact Including " 134.0 147.7 13.7 45 1.24 " RHB-44 South 44.2 45.7 1.5 5 1.13 Volcaniclastics  South zone - Hole RHB44 was a step-out to the east and while with a modest assay result it does confirm that the South zone has some lateral extent. With the limited drilling in the South zone to date geological studies are in progress to define additional drill targets.  Summary: The important aspects of these results are confirmation that: -- the Iceberg deposit hosts the classic Carlin-type very high-grade gold mineralization and, -- has significant quantities of gold in three gold-bearing stratigraphic horizons that are all within 200 meters of surface; the overlying older volcaniclastics (predominantly in the central and southern zone), the contact zone between the Horse Canyon and upper Wenban-8 formations (all three zones), and the middle Wenban5 limestone formation (more prevalent in the north zone). CIO, CTO & Developer Resources  "Our investment in the 7 core holes drilled last fall(i) is paying off, said Dr. Roger Steininger, 'as it greatly advanced our understanding of the stratigraphic controls and structural influences on the gold mineralization in the Iceberg deposit. This has improved our ability to target the higher grade breccia-hosted gold mineralization, which significantly is close enough to surface to have been oxidized as well."  The 2015 exploration program will total approximately 17.5 thousand feet (5,300 meters) of drilling through to the end of August 2015. The next set of six holes are being completed and assays are expected in early June.  Reverse circulation drilling is being conducted by Major Drilling of Salt Lake City, Utah under the supervision of David Mallo, Exploration Manager and Dr. Roger Steininger, COO (CPG 7417). Samples were analyzed by American Assay Labs of Sparks, NV. Sufficient commercially prepared standards, blanks, and duplicates were inserted to assure quality analytical results. Data verification of the analytical results included a statistical analysis of the duplicates, standards and blanks that must pass certain parameters for acceptance to ensure accurate and verifiable results. The reported gold intervals may or may not represent true thicknesses and/or widths as there is insufficient data at this time with respect to the shape of mineralization to calculate its true orientation.  About NuLegacy: NuLegacy Gold has discovered a classic Carlin-type oxidized gold deposit (the Iceberg) which as at end-2014 has an exploration target(ii) of 90 to 110 million tonnes grading between 0.90 gram and 1.10 gram of gold/tonne in the famed Cortez gold-trend of Nevada. The Iceberg is on a 60 sq. km portion of the Cortez optioned from Barrick Gold Corporation and is on trend with three of Barrick`s multi-million ounce Carlin-type systems that are its largest , lowest cost and politically safest gold deposits(iii) in the world. The Iceberg is adjacent(iv) to the third of these, the Goldrush deposit,(v) which is the most significant green-field discovery by a major gold producer in the past five years.  On Behalf Of NuLegacy Gold Corporation  James E Anderson, Chief Executive Officer  Dr. Roger Steininger, NuLegacy's chief operating officer is a Certified Professional Geologist (CPG 7417) and the qualified person as defined by NI 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects responsible for preparing and reviewing the scientific and technical information contained in this news release  Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.  This news release contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or future performance and reflect management's current expectations and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current beliefs and are based on assumptions made by and information currently available to the Company. Readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause future results to differ materially from those expected. There are no known resources or reserves in the Iceberg deposit and the proposed exploration programs are exploratory searches for commercial bodies of ore. In addition, the presence of gold deposits on properties adjacent or in close proximity to the Iceberg Deposit is not necessarily indicative of the gold mineralization on the Iceberg Deposit. All of the forward-looking statements made in this news release are qualified by these cautionary statements and those in our continuous disclosure filings available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com including our annual management's discussion and analysis dated July 25, 2014 for the year ended March 31, 2014. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise them to reflect new events or circumstances save as required under applicable securities legislation.  (i) Our investment was US$700,000 the favorable results of which were reported on Nov. 25, 2014 and Jan. 8, 2015.  (ii) These figures are conceptual in nature and derived from a compilation of 149 historic and 34 NuLegacy drill holes in and around the Iceberg deposit. To date, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.  (iii) As extracted from Barrick's Q4-2013 and Q1-2014 reports.  (iv) The close proximity of the Goldrush deposit to the Iceberg deposit is not necessarily indicative of the gold mineralization in the Iceberg deposit.  (v) As reported by Barrick as of December 31, 2013, the Goldrush deposit contained a resource of 423,000 ounce of gold (3.1 million tons grading 0.137 oz./ton - measured), 9,537,000 ounces (72.5 million tons grading 0.132 oz./ton - indicated) and 5,555,000 ounce (39.5 million tons grading 0.141oz./ton - inferred).

Trinidad Begins 170th Indian Arrival Day Celebrations!@#Email 2  PORT OF SPAIN: The unique aspects of Indo-Trinidadian culture need to be branded and marketed to promote tourism and thereby achieve economic growth and development, said an expert at an event here to mark the 170th anniversary celebrations of the arrival of Indians in Trinidad and Tobago."There is a need to market (our) food, rituals, festivals and heritage from the perspective of selling the unique experiences as part of a tourism product," said economist, playwright, dancer and choreographer Satnarine Balkaransingh at a seminar organised on Wednesday by the National Council of Indian Culture in Divali Nagar, Charlieville, Chaguanas. Balkaransingh said plastic arts could be used "to document and tell our stories, market our rituals and festivals without sacrificing or compromising their sacredness". Underlining the contributions made by Indian migrants in nation building, he said: "We are the successors of a migrant society. Our ancestors improved the economy and fostered national development. The attitudes and values inherent in the Indo-Trinidadian culture, now in its 170th year of existence, has contributed to this national development."The East Indian diaspora was sourced from the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar between 1845 and 1917. They were brought here by the then colonial government to rescue the dying agricultural economy following the end of slavery by the British Parliament in 1834.The first batch of East Indians was the beginning of several journeys amounting to approximately 148,000 East Indians. They brought with them new cuisine, habits, traditions, customs and Hinduism.Balkaransingh pointed out that major public events that Indians brought to Trinidad and Tobago were now national events such as Diwali, Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Azha, Ram Lila, Phagwa and Hosay. "The promotion of Indo-Trinidadian culture must not be done with arrogance and insensitivity to the detriment of other culture," he said, adding that "we must ensure fruitful coexistence and harmony". Pandita Indrani Rampersad, the first official woman priest in Trinidad, said the Indian culture in Trinidad and Tobago is an identity. "This identity is passed on from one generation to the next but it is not static, and to remain relevant, culture changes with time and space."A series of programmes have been planned for the Indian Heritage Month this year to mark the 170th Indian Arrival Day, which is celebrated on May 30. The first ship carrying Indian immigrants reached Trinidad and Tobago on May 30, 1845.The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago has organised an art exhibition with the theme "Drawing from our heritage - Colours of our East Indian culture". "This exhibition aims to create a space for the public to reflect on our nation's East Indian heritage and to continue to envision a beautifully diverse and harmonious multicultural future," the bank's governor Jwala Rambarran said in a message.!@#english

Candidate Narendra Modi vs PM Narendra Modi: Who's the winner? - Business Today!@#Story Candidate Modi vs PM Modi Candidate Modi generated hope at home and scepticism abroad. For Prime Minister Modi, who completes a year in office on May 26, the reverse may be true. Shweta Punj, Anilesh S. Mahajan and Dipak Mondal Edition: May 24, 2015 Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Photo: Rohit Chawla)  Close your eyes and think of Narendra Modi over the last one year. What comes to mind? No, not chest thumping and the roar of the election campaign and victory - that was all Candidate Modi. After that? Too many images? Here, let's help you sort them out.  The country's economy has acquired a new sheen since Modi became Prime Minister and installed Arun Jaitley in the finance ministry. The numbers suggest that something magical has happened. In fact, at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in the US on April 16, Jaitley stopped just short of saying that. However, if you look elsewhere, you are likely to end up very confused. But let us first bask in the numbers.  Presenting a list of the Modi government's accomplishments at Peterson, Jaitley said the audience would have given a cynical laugh if, as a thought experiment, it had been told in late 2013 that all this would be accomplished so soon. The accomplishments he listed are indeed impressive. CPI inflation down to five per cent Current account deficit at 1.7 per cent of the GDP Growth starting to accelerate to over seven per cent Diesel prices deregulated Formula fixed for pricing natural gas The world's largest programme of financial inclusion successfully implemented Agreement secured on the GST Bills passed to reform coal and mining and open up insurance A budget passed which reinvigorates growth by emphasising public investment while maintaining fiscal discipline Direct benefit transfers being implemented based on what the Economic Survey has called the JAM (Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar, and mobile number) trinity The word "scandal" has ceased to be part of popular discourse because major resources like spectrum and coal have been transparently auctioned Land acquisition Bill being modified to reduce the cost of doing business All true. But the incantation was more luck than magic. The sharp, unforeseen fall in global crude oil prices accounts for much of the gains on the fronts of inflation, current account deficit, foreign exchange reserves, and subsidies. Some of the progress in financial inclusion and targeting of subsidies is a carryover from the UPA regime. The land acquisition Bill is still a work in progress, a painstaking one whose troubles are manifested in a farmer's suicide at an AAP rally.  "Inflation coming down from 11 to five per cent is a major achievement - how much of that can be attributed to policies or luck is debatable," says Samiran Chakraborty, Head of South Asia Macro Research, Standard Chartered Bank.  Modi supporters believe that export restrictions on certain farm commodities and a crackdown on hoarding helped rein in food prices.  ECONOMIC TURNAROUND?  For all the luck, this does not quite feel like a 7.5 per cent economy. The fourth quarter results did not match the expectations of many analysts. The excise duty collection, the proof of the Make in India pudding, has grown just 1.5 per cent of the GDP. Revenue collection, at 9.9 per cent of the GDP, has fallen short of budget estimates of 10.6 per cent. Indeed, the core sector - coal, electricity, crude oil, natural gas, steel, cement, fertilisers, and refinery products - shrank 0.1 per cent in March. And this was despite the six and five per cent growth seen in the coal and fertiliser sectors, respectively. Exports, too, have refused to perk up to match the upbeat sentiments Modi brought with him, contracting marginally in 2014/15. 'If we think how grim the situation looked less than two years ago, the transformation could not be more dramatic,' says ARVIND PANAGARIYA, Vice Chairman, Niti Aayog. (Photo: Rohit Chawla)  The labour bureau has given out dismal jobs data. Employment generation in eight crucial sectors during October to December was the slowest in three quarters - a mere 117,000 jobs were created against the more than three million jobs seekers that would have entered the market in those three months.  All this merely gives legitimacy to the naysayers, who argue that the jump in economic growth is merely a result of the Central Statistical Organisation's move to change the base year and jettison factor cost for market prices.  The Budget, as Jaitley said, does indeed lean towards public spending on infrastructure, but it also allowed a slip in the fiscal deficit target from 3.6 to 3.9 per cent. Worse, as former finance minister P. Chidambaram pointed out, this elbow room is not being used to push plan expenditure, which is the productive stuff that builds assets.  Of course, not everyone is a naysayer. "If we think how grim the situation looked less than two years ago, the transformation could not be more dramatic," says Arvind Panagariya, the Indian-American economist who has been appointed the Vice Chairman of National Institution for Transforming India.  HAND-WRINGING INDUSTRY  Candidate Modi was always a big hit with Big Business. They used to come in hordes to the Vibrant Gujarat Summit and lavish unqualified praise on Modi and his style of working. Modi's little text message to Ratan Tata, inviting him to set up the Nano factory in Sanand amid the turmoil in Singur, has been talked about so many times it is a modern corporate legend. Against that backdrop, what Tata said recently sounds discordant.  "All of us should understand that it's a new government, and we need not get disillusioned and dissatisfied so fast," Tata said during the convocation at the Mumbai International School of Business Bocconi. "There's a great deal of hope in the inspirational leadership of Modi? The implementation hasn't really taken form this year. But we still have to give him the opportunity to implement what he has promised."  Obviously, Tata had spotted the rising disillusionment among his peers, not least in the statements of HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh, Marico Group's Harsh Mariwala, and the new CII President Sumit Mazumder.  Tata's is always an influential voice, but some people have a business to run. "I have not seen one thing on ease of doing business," says Rafeeq Ahmed, Chairman of the shoe exporter Farida Group, which employs 17,000 people. "On the contrary we are now being asked to prove that the goods have landed in the export country. I never had any expectation, I have been doing business in India for 55 years. But they gave us hope."  Khalid Khan, who exports diesel engines and auto parts to 22 countries, complains about the recent demand from the customs to submit bank realisation certificates from 2004-2014. "We were not given any time to comply with the notice. They want us to put a landing certificate online, but the site does not have the provision for it. We are talking about Make in India. When will it start?"  Others, too, have their grievances. "Domestic industry is still shy of investing in India because the excess capacity owing to weak domestic demand isn't being offset by accessing overseas markets as the products or services are inadequately competitive in a global arena," says Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director at two wheeler giant Bajaj Auto.  HIGHS AND LAWS  Ahmed, Khan, and others who keep whingeing really need to listen to Ratan Tata. It is not quite right to say nothing has changed. On the contrary, a lot has, or is about to.  After 56 years, the Companies Act - passed during the United Progressive Alliance government tenure in 2013 - has been overhauled. The new one requires companies to set the highest corporate governance standards.  "With the [new] Companies Act, we will see an accounting world very comparable to what we will see in the EU or America - with the consequence that the trust of investors will increase considerably. The other side of the coin is to deal with updated governance regulations," says Peter Wollmert of EY Europe.  No less significant is the draft of five new labour codes that subsume 40 laws. According to reports, the draft law allows companies employing up to 300 workers to lay them off without official sanction. The sanction is now needed if you employ more than 100 workers.  Admittedly, the lead in labour law reform was taken by Rajasthan, but the new law brings the Centre right back in the game. To soften the blow to workers, they, if retrenched, will be paid 45 days' wages, instead of 15 at present. Other changes seek to curb strikes and politicisation of unions. 'Excess capacity owing to weak domestic demand isn't being offset by accessing overseas markets,' says Rajiv Bajaj, MD, Bajaj Auto. "If we have to promote employment, we have to encourage small and medium enterprises. We have to make it easier for them and at the same time protect the health, hygiene and safety of workers," says Labour Secretary Shankar Aggarwal. Much ground has been covered in clearance of projects. Of the 200 referred to the Project Monitoring Group in the power sector, the problems of 103 have been resolved. Of the 77 referred in the coal sector, the path of 30 has been cleared. Of the 26 in railways, 10 are free to rattle ahead.  Roads secretary Vijay Chhibher talks about the 8,000 km of national highways awarded this year - nearly double that last year. "In the next two to three years we will complete 90 per cent of the projects. They will get done, there are no ifs and buts."  More impetus to the sector will come from Bharat Mala, which could rival the Golden Quadrilateral, which had given a fillip to infrastructure and economic growth in the early part of the century under the previous NDA government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Bharat Mala will run from Gujarat to Mizoram - 5,000 km - and cost about Rs 12,000 crore to Rs 14,000 crore.  "With a tremendous amount of backroom work already happening in roads, power, coastal and inland waterways, railways and urban transportation - it is expected that the private sector will see a hockey stick uptick in their order books by Diwali," says Vinayak Chatterjee of Feedback Infra.  That will not be a day too soon. Data show that the domestic industry has remained wary of investing in India. In construction activities, the rate of capital formation declined from 6.5 per cent in 2011/12 to 5.5 per cent in 2013/14.  There has also been considerable progress on the subsidy front, though Modi refuses stoutly to cut them. By the end of March, 123 million LPG consumers had joined the Direct Benefits Transfer scheme. They buy cylinders at market price and the subsidy gets deposited in their bank account. Unfortunately, data errors and coordination between banks and LPG distributors have meant that 2.5 million of 320 million transactions for paying subsidy to consumers have failed, but that's a small percentage.  In all 13 bills, some of them held up for years, have been passed by Parliament since Modi became Prime Minister. In comparison, six bills were passed in 2013 and 18 in 2012.  SINGEING TAXATION  Finance Minister Jaitley did a timely manoeuvre on April 30 to help avoid a situation in which the term tax terrorism - his party had coined it during the election campaign to run down the UPA - would get stuck to the Modi government. As the Finance Bill came up for discussion in the Lok Sabha, Jaitley widened the scope of exemption from MAT on capital gains tax of foreign portfolio investors. It will be applicable not only on the sale of securities but also on other income streams such as interest income, technical fees and royalty. Secondly, this benefit will be available also to foreign debt funds, venture capital funds, and private equity funds.  MAT , or minimum alternate tax, was to be levied on capital gains made by foreign portfolio investors from April 1, 2015. This created a furore over the lack of clarity on taxation of capital gains made before the due date.  The tax department has already started opening up old cases, and raising tax demand on FPIs for their capital gains in the past. According to experts, the tax department can raise demand for seven previous years.  The government had initially said that the total tax demand would be around Rs 40,000 crore. However, after much hue and cry over the issue, the government said that FPIs based in countries with which the government has a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement would be exempt. After this clarification, the income tax department sent notices to 68 FPIs for payment of dues totalling Rs 603 crore. Click here to Enlarge  ICI Global, a body of international investment funds and fund managers with total combined assets of $20 trillion, wrote a strong-worded letter - Business Today has a copy - to the finance minister on April 13. "Our members are extremely concerned and deeply disappointed.... Quite frankly, we are astonished that MAT, which has been applied to only domestic companies since its enactment in 1996, now is being asserted against foreign investors," says the letter.  According to Rahul Garg, Leader, Direct Taxes, PwC, the controversy on MAT is because the government doesn't want to intervene in cases already being heard in different courts. It has taken many steps to resolve issues of transfer pricing and indirect share transfers. Tax demands of up to Rs 4 lakh crore are under dispute in different courts.  "The roll-back provisions under advance pricing agreements (APAs) was a big positive," says Mukesh Butani, Managing Partner, BMR Advisors. The key, he says, is the strong message that the government has sent about retrospective taxation and its commitment to a stable tax regime. The government's decision not to appeal a High Court ruling in favour of Vodafone, absolving the company in a Rs 3,200 crore transfer pricing case, allayed the fears of foreign companies.  The government is also moving towards the much awaited Goods and Services Tax (GST), an indirect tax proposal that seeks to replace the plethora of central and state government levies. To clear the final hurdle, the government has promised the states to compensate for five years any losses due to implementation of GST. At the time this article was finalised, the government was planning to table the GST Bill in the Lok Sabha.  However, without taking anything away from the changes and the intent, tax administration is in much need of reform, one that will change the attitude of officers. Tax officers have their targets and often demands are raised on companies to meet these targets. "While there is a change in the attitude of policy makers, the attitude of policy implementers has not changed yet," says S.P. Singh, Senior Director, Deloitte Haskin & Sells. WINNING ABROAD  "Like India, he transcends the ancient and the modern - a devotee of yoga who connects with Indian citizens on Twitter and imagines a 'digital India'."  That's the United States President Barack Obama writing about Prime Minister Modi in Time magazine. Some called it a love note. Not too long ago, the US had refused a visa to Modi.  On second thoughts, that was a long time ago, before Modi became Prime Minister. Since then, he has travelled to 16 countries, each welcoming him with much fanfare (his Madison Square gig was compared with those of rock stars). World leaders have competed with the Indian diaspora of their countries in fawning over Modi. Many agreements and MoUs have been signed. For instance, China and Japan have promised investments of $20 billion and $30 billion respectively. They will take time to show up as investments on the ground in India, but the perception of success is undeniable.  "I think there are great achievements on foreign policy. International ties should build economic and strategic partnerships. Strengthening our ties with France, Germany, Japan, Korea, the US, and Australia is building a strategic and economic foundation," says Ajit Ranade, President and Chief Economist of Aditya Birla Group.  The world is once again looking at India favourably and the fact that the first year of the government has gone without any scams augurs well.  According to a World Bank Development update, the Indian economy is in a much brighter spot and is poised to grow at 7.5 per cent in the current year. The Country Director of World Bank, Onno Ruhl, however, adds that there is a need for reducing the pipeline of stuck projects, especially in the Public Private Partnership space for lifting the investment rates.  Ruhl need not fret. One of the two Modis should be able to take care of that. - ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY CHITRA NARAYANAN; RESEARCH INPUTS BY NITI KIRAN  (Follow the authors on Twitter: @shwetapunj; @anileshmahajan; @Dipak_Journo) !@#english
The stock markets had it coming!@#A 723-point, or 2.63%, fall in the Sensex to its lowest point this year may seem like a sharp and sudden fall, but Indian equities had it coming for quite some time now. The difficulties being faced by the new government and the lack of traction in company earnings are increasingly showing up in the market’s dips. Local equities are the worst performing major market this year, as is evident from chart 1. The Modi magic is fading from the markets. A major concern is that despite the new GDP (gross domestic product) numbers promising a wonderful year, demand continues to remain soft indicating that expectations from the change of guard at the centre are waning. The HSBC India Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index shows that private sector activity fell to a six-month low of 52.5 in April as both manufacturing and services sector recovery is yet to find a firm footing. What’s worse, companies are shedding jobs. In the past six months, the Sensex has fallen 6 % following the trend in the Composite PMI, as the chart 2 shows. Markets rise or fall based on new information and they are increasingly discounting the prospects of a stimulus in China and a less moribund future for Europe. In contrast, after the initial euphoria in India, markets have come to face a more sober reality. While there is no danger of an immediate oil shock, crude oil prices have also gained over 40% since their lows of last year. Foreign institutional investors, who were gung-ho on India not too long ago, have become bearish owing to lack of recovery in economic fundamentals. A tax row with the government over the retrospective levy of minimum alternate tax has only increased their dislike for Indian stocks. They have sold around Rs. 12,661 crore since mid-April, according to data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India. This number doesn’t include Daiichi Sankyo’s sale of its Sun Pharma stake. “When the market falls like a knife, no one wants to catch it,” said Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst. A continued fall may have spurred those investors who funded their share purchases with margin money to sell, making it a vicious cycle. Secondly, as Prime Database numbers show, cash-strapped promoters of Indian firms continue to pledge more shares. At the end of the last fiscal year, promoter pledging for 495 NSE-listed companies rose to Rs. 1.94 trillion, or 43% of their holdings. In a falling market, people who hold these shares as collateral may sell to maintain margins, which leads to a further fall in prices. With the Met department predicting a below-normal monsoon and no signs of revival of private sector capital expenditure, there is no trigger for the markets to rise. There is nothing in the legislative agenda that increases optimism either. The land acquisition and real estate bill are still stuck. Although, the goods and services tax bill cleared the Lok Sabha, its real test will be in the upper house where the government is a minority. “There is no likelihood of capex by the private sector over the next one year. The selling will continue until such negative sentiment prevails and there is going to be more pain between now and Diwali,” said Saurabh Mukherjea, head of institutional equities at Ambit Capital Pvt Ltd.​!@#english
Strawberries are the Superfruit Missing from Your Daily Diet!@#Strawberries are the Superfruit Missing from Your Daily Diet New Survey Shows 37 Percent of People See this Nutrient Powerhouse as 'Just Dessert' May 7, 2015 06:29 AM EDT Blog This  WATSONVILLE, Calif. , May 7, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The California Strawberry Commission (CSC) today announced the results of a consumer survey exploring what, how and why Americans choose the fruit they eat for their day-to-day nutrition. According to the survey, most Americans have misconceptions about strawberries that may cause them to miss out on the benefits of strawberries in their daily diet. When asked for their preference between five common fruits (oranges, apples, bananas, grapes and strawberries), more than a third (36 percent) of respondents chose strawberries as their favorite. However, when asked which they consume the most, only 12 percent of respondents indicated strawberries as their most consumed fruit.  Probing further, the CSC survey uncovered that misnomers about certain fruits may be steering people away from strawberries as a daily go-to fruit.  "When it comes to fruit, Americans tend to follow a routine," says registered dietitian Mitzi Dulan . "Grab a banana when on the run, reach for an orange when sick and have an apple a day to keep the doctor away. All fruits are healthy snack choices, but greater variety is important to get a bigger nutrition boost any time of the day. Strawberries are packed with essential vitamins, dietary fiber, potassium, antioxidants and are a great option to change things up with a favorite fruit."  Myth Busting Strawberries  Part of making healthier decisions starts with debunking misconceptions. The survey indicates that respondents believe other fruit (apples, oranges, bananas and grapes) are better sources of nutrients like vitamin C and fiber and more beneficial overall for weight management and prevention of some chronic diseases. Belief: Strawberries have more sugar than other fruits. Only, 18 percent of respondents believed strawberries to be the lowest sugar fruit when compared to apples, oranges, bananas and grapes. Fact: Strawberries have the lowest amount of sugar (7 grams) per one-cup serving compared to these other popular fruits.  With only 45 calories per serving, they are an excellent choice for diabetes-friendly meal plans. In fact, the American Diabetes Association identifies berries, including strawberries, as one of the top ten superfoods for a diabetes meal plan because they are packed with vitamins, antioxidants and dietary fiber. 1 Belief: Oranges have more vitamin C per serving than strawberries. Eighty-six percent of respondents thought oranges had the most Vitamin C per serving. Fact: A one-cup serving of strawberries has more vitamin C than an orange. Vitamin C is known for its antioxidant properties, helping to protect the body from oxidative stress.  For Your Kids  The survey also revealed that we aren't just neglecting this favorite superfruit for ourselves. The majority of respondents indicated they are most likely to pack fruit other than strawberries in school lunches – only nine percent indicated strawberries as their preferred lunchbox option. The vitamin C, folate, fiber, potassium and associated benefits make strawberries a great choice for keeping kids healthy. Get tips for simple lunchbox recipes here .  For Everyday  So why don't people eat strawberries more often? The survey indicates that most people maintain the belief that strawberries are a dessert-only treat. When respondents were asked when they are most likely to eat strawberries, the majority (37 percent) said "as a dessert," whereas only 14 percent said "as part of a meal." As few as three percent said that they're most likely to grab strawberries while on the move versus other fruits. CIO, CTO & Developer Resources  Registered dietitian Mitzi Dulan notes, "We're saving strawberries for dessert, but we're not taking advantage of the year-round availability of California strawberries and all the great health benefits they offer during the rest of the day. Strawberries are incredibly versatile and can be cooked, frozen, and blended for use in all kinds of dishes from breakfast through dinner."  Here are some helpful hints for ways to add a serving of California strawberries to your diet:  A strawberry can act like a tomato. Consider a Caprese salad made with fresh mozzarella and strawberries. Transform a grilled cheese-and-tomato sandwich into a panino with strawberries and a savory cheese like Provolone.  Strawberries are salad friendly. Add sliced strawberries to your favorite leafy greens. To create fresh twists on classic dressings, use puréed strawberries to stand in for some or all of the vinegar. They'll add tangy sweetness, body and aromatic appeal.  Strawberries pair perfectly with proteins. Top grilled chicken or fish with a fresh fruit salsa.  Frozen strawberries can be super ice cubes. Add frozen strawberries, instead of ice, directly to blender drinks.  Connect with @CAstrawberries on Facebook, Instagram , Pinteres t and Twitter for daily recipe ideas.  About California Strawberry Commission The California Strawberry Commission is a state government agency charged with conducting research to support California's 400 strawberry growers, shippers and processors.

Trinidad begins 170th Indian Arrival Day celebrations!@#Trinidad begins 170th Indian Arrival Day celebrations  Shipping Industry News.Net (IANS) : Thursday 7th May, 2015  The unique aspects of Indo-Trinidadian culture need to be branded and marketed to promote tourism and thereby achieve economic growth and development, said an expert at an event here to mark the 170th anniversary celebrations of the arrival of Indians in Trinidad and Tobago.  "There is a need to market (our) food, rituals, festivals and heritage from the perspective of selling the unique experiences as part of a tourism product," said economist, playwright, dancer and choreographer Satnarine Balkaransingh at a seminar organised on Wednesday by the National Council of Indian Culture in Divali Nagar, Charlieville, Chaguanas.  Balkaransingh said plastic arts could be used "to document and tell our stories, market our rituals and festivals without sacrificing or compromising their sacredness".  Underlining the contributions made by Indian migrants in nation building, he said: "We are the successors of a migrant society. Our ancestors improved the economy and fostered national development. The attitudes and values inherent in the Indo-Trinidadian culture, now in its 170th year of existence, has contributed to this national development."  The East Indian diaspora was sourced from the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar between 1845 and 1917. They were brought here by the then colonial government to rescue the dying agricultural economy following the end of slavery by the British Parliament in 1834.  The first batch of East Indians was the beginning of several journeys amounting to approximately 148,000 East Indians. They brought with them new cuisine, habits, traditions, customs and Hinduism.  Balkaransingh pointed out that major public events that Indians brought to Trinidad and Tobago were now national events such as Diwali, Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Azha, Ram Lila, Phagwa and Hosay.  "The promotion of Indo-Trinidadian culture must not be done with arrogance and insensitivity to the detriment of other culture," he said, adding that "we must ensure fruitful coexistence and harmony".  Pandita Indrani Rampersad, the first official woman priest in Trinidad, said the Indian culture in Trinidad and Tobago is an identity. "This identity is passed on from one generation to the next but it is not static, and to remain relevant, culture changes with time and space."  A series of programmes have been planned for the Indian Heritage Month this year to mark the 170th Indian Arrival Day, which is celebrated on May 30.  The first ship carrying Indian immigrants reached Trinidad and Tobago on May 30, 1845.  The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago has organised an art exhibition with the theme "Drawing from our heritage - Colours of our East Indian culture".  "This exhibition aims to create a space for the public to reflect on our nation's East Indian heritage and to continue to envision a beautifully diverse and harmonious multicultural future," the bank's governor Jwala Rambarran said in a message.

Titan Q4 profit up 11.1% to Rs823.07 crore - Livemint!@#Home » Companies Titan Q4 profit up 11.1% to Rs823.07 crore Income from the firm’s jewellery segment, which accounts for more than 80% of its business, grew 9.2% to Rs. 9430 crore Flipkart now considers raising debt Shares of Titan fell 3.19% to close at Rs. 370.05 on Thursday while the BSE Sensex was down by 0.44% to 26,599.11 points. Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint Bengaluru: Titan Co. Ltd on Thursday said net profit for the quarter ended March rose 11.1% from a year ago to Rs. 823.07 crore despite weak demand for gold jewellery, which was offset by lower material costs and cut in advertising expenses. Revenue rose 9% to Rs. 11,791 crore. Income from the company’s jewellery segment, which accounts for more than 80% of its business, grew 9.2% to Rs. 9430 crore. It was a tough quarter, said Bhaskar Bhat, Titan’s managing director. He said consumer demand had been lukewarm and after the Diwali festival, growth has been on the decline. “Our jewellery business was impacted by regulatory changes and termination of the Gold Harvest Scheme,” he said. The jewellery purchase scheme was discontinued in July last year when changes were made to the Companies Act. It was restarted in November. Under the scheme, customers paid 11 monthly installments for gold purchases and Titan gave them one month’s installment as a promotion or discount. Shares of Titan fell 3.19% to close at Rs. 370.05 on Thursday while the BSE Sensex was down by 0.44% to 26,599.11 points. !@#english
Doubts and divisions!@#- Between prosperity and recklessness Swapan Dasgupta Late last month, while waiting in the lobby of a Central London hotel, I was buttonholed by a Greek gentleman and asked whether I too was part of the St George's Day lunch being held in the premises. He was in a very jolly mood after what appeared to be a high-spirited afternoon and we got talking. "I thought St George's Day was an English celebration. Is it observed in Greece?" I asked, in what was a shameful display of ignorance. "It is a big day in Greece and Cyprus, a national holiday," he informed me. Despite its overt identification with England - courtesy, I guess, the football fans - St George's Day is yet to be declared a national holiday in England. That could be because national holidays in the United Kingdom tend to be infrequent and, apart from the four days of Easter and the two days of Christmas, remarkably non-denominational - bank holidays in May and August do not offend the prevailing spirit of multiculturalism. Groups and communities celebrate everything from Eid, Diwali, Guy Fawkes Day, the Solar Solstice and the Queen's official birthday. But national holidays tend to be seriously rationed. When it comes to the United Kingdom - a curious mixture of a Heritage State and post-national cosmopolitanism - it is always hazardous to talk of new traditions. However, I would like to hazard the guess that very shortly, maybe even in a year's time, St George's Day may well become the newest of national holidays in England, celebrated with the same measure of joyousness as St Patrick's Day in the Republic of Ireland. The outcome of the British general election of May 7 is in some doubt. The number of seats won by the political parties will no doubt be known by the time this edition of the newspapers reaches readers, but who will be prime minister and which coalition will endure the statutory five-year term of the House of Commons will, in all likelihood, take a longer time to determine. However, regardless of the detailed outcome, historians may well come to regard the 2015 poll as a landmark election - as significant as the Liberal win in 1906, the Labour landslide of 1945 or, for that matter, Margaret Thatcher's victory in 1979. The landmark elections of the 20th century were defined in terms of the social and economic legislation that flowed from their Parliaments. The Liberal and Labour governments elected in 1906 and 1945 created the modern British welfare State; and the Conservative 'counter-revolution' of 1979 re-established the primacy of the market economy and globalization. In 2015, regardless of whether David Cameron or Ed Miliband is resident of 10 Downing Street, the UK is likely to witness a new phenomenon: the regionalization of politics that threatens its very survival. To those familiar with late-Victorian and Edwardian Britain, this isn't as new as it seems. The Home Rule agitation led to a sizable Irish nationalist bloc in Westminster with priorities that were totally at variance with the assumptions of the Liberals and the Tories, then the two national parties. Accommodating Irish aspirations within the Westminster system that involved the pre-eminence of Parliament proved impossible and increasingly the separatist Irish MPs began to be viewed as a tumour that Britain was best rid of. What contributed most significantly to the exasperation of both the Tory leader, Lord Salisbury, and the Liberal stalwart, William Gladstone, was that a solid bloc of some 85 Irish nationalist MPs held the balance of power amid fierce competition between the two parties in the other regions of the UK. In 1892, Gladstone became prime minister on the strength of 'outside' support of the Irish nationalists. But far from integrating Ireland into the power structure, the inconclusive talks on Home Rule increased the gulf between Catholic Ireland and the rest of the UK. When Ireland finally went its own way, Winston Churchill wrote impishly, "The two supreme services which Ireland has rendered Britain are her accession to the Allied cause on the outbreak of the Great War, and her withdrawal from the House of Commons at its close." History doesn't always repeat itself but it just may. Scottish nationalism, fuelled on tales of Jacobite valour, had always enjoyed folklore status in Scotland but politically it was insignificant until the Scottish National Party beat Labour into second place in the Scottish Parliament election of 2007. Since then, it has been an upward journey, despite the resounding No vote in the 2014 referendum when Labour and Conservative joined forces, to the point where it is expected to win more than 50 of the 59 seats from Scotland. If this landslide does become a reality and the Conservatives fail to win 24 extra seats in England and Wales, the SNP will hold the balance of power. In a situation reminiscent of the 1890s, the UK government will be held hostage to a party that is limited to just one region and which has a clear pro-independence agenda. On paper, the SNP isn't demanding another referendum: it is seeking to make governance impossible. At present, the differences between the SNP and the rest seem irreconcilable. First, it is quite firmly opposed to fiscal austerity and controlling the fiscal deficit. It wants a steep increase in spending on health and education that is beyond the capacity of the British exchequer. Secondly, it seeks a drastic reduction in defence expenditure and the scrapping of the Trident programme. Thirdly, it is firmly committed to enhancing Britain's engagement in the European Union at a time when the mood in England is sharply opposed to the curtailment of national sovereignty. Finally, it has no intention of giving up its demand for an independent Scotland as the price for power sharing in Westminster. It is, in fact, seeking to create an emotional schism between England and Scotland to the point when there is widespread relief in both London and the Shires at the departure of Scotland from the Union. So far, Scotland has bred a nationalism that is a blend of "progressive politics" (a euphemism for hard Left economics and trendy social policies) and "civic nationalism". There has been no countervailing reaction in England, although both Conservatives and Labour grudgingly acknowledge that English identity needs to be taken on board and rescued from mavericks on the Far Right. However, if the SNP decides to force its agenda on a Labour that is under pressure from its committed grass roots to unsettle the legacy of the Tory-Lib-Dem coalition that has ruled since 2010, we are likely to see open warfare between a Britain that seeks to combine prosperity with stability and another Britain whose mood has become increasingly reckless. During the election campaign the Conservatives have tangentially invoked English nationalism by invoking the larger threat posed by the SNP. However, if floating voters, in the belief that this is just another routine election, fail to accord this message any urgency, Britain could be in for turbulent times. As a major financial hub of international capital, any move to impose punitive taxes on the successful will see both a flight of capital and a run on Sterling. Only two major countries in the EU - Germany and the UK - have staged a recovery from the financial crisis that hit the world of capitalism in 2008. In the case of UK, the turnaround has been more modest. The politics in the aftermath of today's results will determine whether the forward movement is maintained or sharply reversed. Celebrating St George's Day in a dispirited London doesn't look terribly appetizing. In a more normal UK it can be exhilarating.!@#english

"People buy only one greeting card at a time, but it's different with stationery": Youhan Aria, Archies!@#In Advertising | May 08, 2015 The greeting cards and stationery brand has launched a campaign for Mother's Day which is starkly different from its earlier ones depicting joy and celebrations. Mother's Day is around the corner. For greeting cards and stationery brand Archies, the day is not just about celebrating motherhood, but also about raising awareness about issues that mothers may face. And thus, moving away from its usual, sunshine-happy campaign, the brand has released a film on the widows of Varanasi who have been left alone by their children.  "There are a lot of women who have been abandoned by their children because of poverty in the cities of Varanasi and Vrindavan. The 'mataaein', as they are called, have either been left behind or have come on their own after being deserted by the family. We wanted to not just highlight the plight of these widows, but also start a conversation about this," explains independent brand associate Vishal Sharma. Sharma worked with a team of creative individuals from Mumbai and Delhi to create the campaign in his personal capacity.  The film highlights the plight of the 'maataein' and tells the story through their eyes - financial difficulties, physical hardships and, most importantly, the feeling of not having anyone. However, strikingly enough, the mothers in the film do not harbour any anger towards their children. The brand, therefore, has requested people to come forward and adopt a mother.  A customer can either donate for the cause by adding whatever amount he wishes to, to his bill, and the brand will match his donation; or he can directly reach out to an NGO that is working in the field to help the Vrindavan widows. According to Sharma, it is all the more important because, demographically, India has more women living alone than men, since men tend to live shorter lives. The youth especially have to be sensitised about the topic, he feels. Which is why, along with the digital film, there would be tent cards kept in all the 237 company-owned stores of Archies.  The activity is being held only in the company-owned stores of Archies across the country. With a presence in 70 cities, which includes metros as well as tier I and II cities, the brand also has 240+ franchise stores. However, a bulk of its sales comes in from the metro regions like Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi NCR.  "Our company-owned stores see a lot of walk-in customers, young parents with their children for Mother's Day, who wouldn't usually come to an Archies store. They probably want to buy something for their mothers or want to help their children get a card for their mother. While for this campaign, we are targeting the youth and teenagers, our TG is varied, thanks to the wide range of products we have," says Youhan Darrab Aria, head - corporate communications, Archies.  A few days prior to any occasion, Archies sees a sudden increase in sales. While Aria claims that there still are people who buy cards, how does the social media generation impact the brand which went the e-com way 15 years back?  Aria shares that, of the total sales, the company-owned stores contribute 70 per cent, while online sales account for only 2 per cent. The rest comes from distributors, franchises and retailers. But, understanding the importance of e-commerce, the company has been pushing online by relaunching the site and putting in more money. The 2 per cent sales contribution is likely to double this year, Aria hopes.  "The guy who sent out 30 cards for Diwali is not there anymore. And teenagers are also wishing each other on social media. But then, while that has decreased, the demand for value - in the form of musical cards, light and sound cards have increased," adds Aria.  Archies spends around Rs. 2.5-3 crore on advertising and marketing in a year. According to its financial results, in the Oct-Dec quarter of 2014, of the total revenue of Rs. 51.91 crore, around Rs. 11.6 crore came from greeting cards, Rs. 10 crore from stationery items and Rs. 30 crore from the sale of gifts. However, while the revenues from greeting cards and gifts have decreased quarter-on-quarter, stationery has increased its strong hold in the company's portfolio.  According to Aria, the focus for the company has, for the last couple of years, been on growing the stationery segment. "We wanted to look at what is growing, or what has potential to grow. You cannot force someone to buy a greeting card. If he has already bought one, he has no need for another. But, people like to buy stationery. That said, we have noticed that sale of cards have gone up year-on-year, during Mother's Day, because, while people wish friends on social media, they cannot do that with their mothers. For Friendship Day and Daughter's Day, which we started in 1995 and 2007, this is not true because Friendship Day is more of a teenage celebration. And teenagers nowadays wish each other on WhatsApp and Facebook."  Abhijith Shetty, brand strategy director, Orchard Advertising (a division of Leo Burnett), was indeed moved by the film and its refreshing approach towards a Mother's Day campaign. "First up, it is brilliantly made - the first-person narrative makes for very gripping storytelling. While most brands would opt for an idea that revolves around the target consumer and her mother, Archies has brilliantly chosen to shift focus to the needs of a completely different set of moms...the ones who need the most help and loving," he says.  He adds, "I am of the opinion that successful brands of the future will increasingly weave public good and social responsibility into whatever they do. But, will it compel the WhatsApp generation to go to a store to donate/buy a card? No, it won't. This generation is far too busy to be inconvenienced to physically go looking for an Archies store. However, the heartening thing is that they need not go to a store - there is, after all, the option of going to the URL of the page to make the donation. In conclusion - would this make more people buy more Archies cards? Probably not. But, would it make more people feel for the brand and contribute to a cause? Perhaps, yes."!@#english

Twitter's techniques used to help students lower tuition costs!@#Twitter's techniques used to help students lower tuition costs #Scholarships150Tips is a millennial-friendly read that encourages pursuit of scholarships May 7, 2015 07:42 PM EDT  RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. , May 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --  About the book:  In order to communicate in a language that students understand, the author has used Twitter lingo in her most recent scholarship book , #Scholarships150Tips. As our lives move at a rapid pace and technology produces more information than we can digest, this hashtag version of her previous book , Let Scholarships Pay the Way attempts to entice students. The full length version received stellar reviews from both students and teachers:  "I graduated with NO DEBT and $25.00 credit using the Andrews System! What a great feeling!" Gyda Deahn "Dee" Boyd, B.A. Psychology, Student Veterans Advocate, MSW Candidate  Kirkus Reviews called it a "thorough, informative guide to managing finances in college and finding financial support for higher education."  Andrews harnessed the concept behind Twitter's popularity: bite-sized knowledge. This summarized version aims to be the most concise way to communicate essay-writing and scholarship-winning techniques to millennials. CIO, CTO & Developer Resources  About the author:  Eve-Marie Andrews created a college level scholarship class about eighteen years ago and developed a system for researching and applying for scholarships. In 2007, her first book, The Search for Scholarships, was published and in November 2014 , a completely revised edition, Let Scholarships Pay the Way, became the new textbook for her class.  Eve-Marie reluctantly retired as a full-time counselor/instructor in June 2014 , but continues to teach both a lecture class and two online classes on scholarships. She now devotes her time to being a Scholarship Consultant and a Motivational Speaker at local events. Her purpose in life continues to be teaching and encouraging students to submit winning scholarship applications.

Delight in Diversity!@#| 2:30 am  “Diversity: the art of thinking independently together”– Malcolm Forbes  Studies show the correlation between diversity and innovation . Yet Silicon Valley, the cradle of tech innovation, portrays the image of a “bro-grammer” culture where 20-something white guys work in a testosterone-fueled environment to create the next technology revolution. This sends a confusing message to leaders – fostering diversity is good for you in theory, but it is hard work, and it is not how the cool kids do it.   In this blog, I want to make a different argument: Working on a diverse team is delightful! Leaders can use team diversity to enhance their employee engagement.   Let me share with you some examples of delightful diversity in the Design and Co-Innovation Center (DCC) here at SAP.   Geographical Diversity  SAP is a global company, and we work with colleagues and customers all over the world. Even in one location, we have team members from diverse counties of origin. It is not unusual to hear different languages and accents in the hallway.   For example, in the DCC in Palo Alto, we have 25 colleagues who speak 19 languages among us. And this translates to tangible customer value. When assigning team members to projects, we consider languages spoken in addition to domain knowledge, skill set and availability. This diversity enables us to delight the customer in unexpected ways.   Case in point: A few months ago, a customer delegation visited us from Thailand to learn about our design process, and we were able to present to them in Thai. This was a pleasant surprise to the customer who had expected English. The customer’s group appreciated us going the extra mile, and this gesture enabled us to establish a deeper connection to them. Of course, this was only made possible by the multi-lingual nature of our team.   We celebrate our cultural diversity by observing the various regional celebrations during our team meetings. Here are some of our team celebrations from the last two years:   Christmas with German Glühwein (festive wine)  Diwali with mithai sweets  Nowruz (the Persian new year) with Haft Seen (the seven traditional table settings)  Rosh Hashanah with honey and apples  Chinese New Year with red envelopes and chocolate gold coins (similar to Hanukkah gelt)  Chinese moon festival with moon cakes  Thanksgiving cross-cultural potluck  Halloween with costumes and candy   This diversity comes with small inconveniences. When organizing team lunches or dinners, we make it a point to accommodate everyone’s dietary restrictions and preferences — whether it is someone who is a vegetarian or someone fasting for Ramadan. It is worth the extra step to accommodate our diversity.  Generational Diversity   In the DCC we have team members who are recent university graduates, and those with over two decades of experience. We assign experienced mentors to new employees to accelerate their learning curve. Interestingly, we find the experienced team members learn as much from the new graduates as the other way around. This generational diversity has to be managed carefully, so the experienced employees do not feel threatened or devalued, and the new employees are integrated quickly and start to feel productive.   We foster a culture of team reviews where we openly share our work and invite feedback from peers. Good feedback can come from anyone, regardless of his or her seniority. This reinforces our focus on learning, and it inspires our team every day.   Of course, this generational diversity means we have to be thoughtful in picking team-building activities. To be inclusive, we request the team members to suggest activities, and the team votes to pick a winner. Recently, we went through this process and the activity that won was a graffiti workshop in San Francisco. It took us a few weeks to go through the selection process but it was worth it, since everyone felt included and had a great time.  Gender Diversity  In our team, we don’t entertain any stereotypical view of gender. We have strong women and empathetic men just as we have strong men and empathetic women. What unites us is our love for design and our customer focus. As a female leader, I strive to set a good example by being authentic in my leadership style. Compassion, empathy, professionalism, customer focus and design excellence are values we live by regardless of gender.   Our focus on family benefits all. We have new moms and dads in the team, and people in different stages of life. We consider a team member’s personal commitments and plan project work or travel around it. It adds an additional layer of complexity in planning, but is worth it since it builds strong bonds in the team.   We invite family and friends to visit our beautiful open offices in Palo Alto. We have had our team members’ children, spouses, siblings, parents, in-laws, aunts and uncles stop by. We take the time to show them our work and explain to them what we do. I personally love to do this, since it helps me articulate our message of design innovation in simple words that will resonate with a non-technical audience. We keep our team table stocked with treats such as fruit bars and baked goods, so visitors feel welcome, embodying our team’s empathy and service mindset.   To conclude, working in a diverse team is delightful, and you are missing out if your team is not! If you are inspired to make your team more diverse, check out my next blog Diversity by Design.

Elite Surgical Center Offers Less Invasive Bariatric Alternatives Available to Less Obese Patients!@#Elite Surgical Center Offers Less Invasive Bariatric Alternatives Available to Less Obese Patients Two new weight loss procedures offer patients an incision-less alternative to traditional bariatric surgery. May 7, 2015 08:39 PM EDT Blog This  FREMONT, Calif. , May 7, 2015 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- In recent years, doctors have worked to adopt the most advanced and efficient bariatric procedures. Although the medical benefits and safety of traditional weight loss surgery have been proven, new, minimally invasive procedures are being created to fulfill the needs of a larger number of patients. Elite Surgical Center in Fremont, California is offering two of these promising new procedures, the Endoscopic Primary Obesity Surgery Endolumenal (POSE) and the Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG). Both procedures use endoscopic tools and techniques to mirror the sleeve gastrectomy and the gastric plication, but without the need for an incision. Importantly, these procedures are available to patients who do not fit the medical definition of severe obesity.  As performed by the medical team at Elite Surgical Center in Fremont , these procedures work as follows. POSE – By entering the gastric tract orally, surgeons performing the POSE procedure are able to reduce the size of the stomach by folding the stomach in a way that greatly reduces its capacity, allowing patients to feel full sooner. ESG – The ESG works similarly, in that it uses oral endoscopic entry to limit the capacity of the stomach. It differs in that it uses sutures to close off a portion of the stomach, rather than folding it. This creates a similar result to a gastric sleeve but, because 80 percent of the stomach is simply closed off rather than completely removed, it can be reversed, if necessary.  While procedures like the gastric sleeve, Lap Band, and the gastric bypass are tried and true options, patients seeking out weight loss surgery in Fremont California should also consider these new incision-free options as well, particularly if they have weight problems that are short of severe obesity. To learn more about these revolutionary new options for weight loss, you can call Elite Surgical Center at (510) 556-5000, or visit them online at www.elitesurgicalcenter.com .

Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Signs Agreement to Purchase a Stake in the Combined Three U.K. and O2 U.K. Entity!@#SYS-CON MEDIA Authors: Elizabeth White , Pat Romanski , Judith Hurwitz , David H Deans , tru welu News Feed Item Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Signs Agreement to Purchase a Stake in the Combined Three U.K. and O2 U.K. Entity Deal subject to completion of Hutchison Whampoa's purchase of O2 U.K. from Telefonica S.A. May 7, 2015 08:27 PM EDT Blog This  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM and TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (Marketwired) -- 05/07/15 -- Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) announced today that it has signed an agreement to acquire an approximate 12% stake, by investing GBP 1.1 billion alongside Hutchison Whampoa (HWL), in the entity that will be created by merging O2 U.K. and Three U.K. CPPIB is among a number of investors including GIC Pte Ltd, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, Limpart Holdings Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and BTG Pactual, who have agreed to invest GBP 3.1 billion in total in the new merged entity, alongside HWL.  On March 25th, 2015, HWL, the parent company of U.K. telecom operator Three, entered into an agreement with Telefonica S.A. to purchase its U.K. subsidiary, O2 U.K. The purchase price of GBP 9.25 billion will be paid at closing and deferred upside interest sharing payments of up to a further GBP 1 billion in the aggregate payable after the cumulative cash flow of the combined businesses of Three U.K. and O2 U.K. has reached an agreed threshold.  "This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a meaningful stake in what will become a leading mobile operator in the U.K., giving us immediate scale in an important sector," said Mark Jenkins, Senior Managing Director & Global Head of Private Investments, CPPIB. "We expect this investment will generate attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns, which is appealing for an investor like CPPIB."  Mr. Jenkins added, "This is also an excellent opportunity to continue investing in the U.K., an important market for CPPIB, and we look forward to working with Hutchison Whampoa to continue growing this business." CIO, CTO & Developer Resources  Commenting on the agreement Canning Fok, Group Managing Director of HWL said:  "It is an honour to have such a strong collection of the world's largest and most sophisticated investors joining us as partners in building the combined business of Three and O2 U.K., which will be the number one mobile operator in the U.K. with nearly 33 million customers. The investors share our vision and belief in the value of creating a business with the necessary scale to enable us to compete effectively in the U.K. marketplace and to provide even better service and innovation using the largest and most resilient and advanced mobile network infrastructure in the country. Like us, the willingness of these investors to commit substantial capital to this investment reflects continued confidence in the U.K. economy and its commitment to maintain and foster a dynamic and world leading telecommunications sector, as well as a vote of confidence in Europe's plans for a single market in digital communications, leading to increased investment in the telecoms sector."  The CPPIB investment is expected to close in 2016 as it is subject to customary closing conditions, including competition approvals for the transaction between HWL and Telefonica.

Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Signs Agreement to Purchase a Stake in the Combined Three U.K. and O2 U.K. Entity!@#SYS-CON MEDIA Authors: Elizabeth White , Pat Romanski , Judith Hurwitz , David H Deans , tru welu News Feed Item Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Signs Agreement to Purchase a Stake in the Combined Three U.K. and O2 U.K. Entity Deal subject to completion of Hutchison Whampoa's purchase of O2 U.K. from Telefonica S.A. May 7, 2015 08:26 PM EDT Blog This  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM and TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (Marketwired) -- 05/08/15 -- Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) announced today that it has signed an agreement to acquire an approximate 12% stake, by investing GBP 1.1 billion alongside Hutchison Whampoa (HWL), in the entity that will be created by merging O2 U.K. and Three U.K. CPPIB is among a number of investors including GIC Pte Ltd, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, Limpart Holdings Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and BTG Pactual, who have agreed to invest GBP 3.1 billion in total in the new merged entity, alongside HWL.  On March 25th, 2015, HWL, the parent company of U.K. telecom operator Three, entered into an agreement with Telefonica S.A. to purchase its U.K. subsidiary, O2 U.K. The purchase price of GBP 9.25 billion will be paid at closing and deferred upside interest sharing payments of up to a further GBP 1 billion in the aggregate payable after the cumulative cash flow of the combined businesses of Three U.K. and O2 U.K. has reached an agreed threshold.  "This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a meaningful stake in what will become a leading mobile operator in the U.K., giving us immediate scale in an important sector," said Mark Jenkins, Senior Managing Director & Global Head of Private Investments, CPPIB. "We expect this investment will generate attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns, which is appealing for an investor like CPPIB."  Mr. Jenkins added, "This is also an excellent opportunity to continue investing in the U.K., an important market for CPPIB, and we look forward to working with Hutchison Whampoa to continue growing this business." CIO, CTO & Developer Resources  Commenting on the agreement Canning Fok, Group Managing Director of HWL said:  "It is an honour to have such a strong collection of the world's largest and most sophisticated investors joining us as partners in building the combined business of Three and O2 U.K., which will be the number one mobile operator in the U.K. with nearly 33 million customers. The investors share our vision and belief in the value of creating a business with the necessary scale to enable us to compete effectively in the U.K. marketplace and to provide even better service and innovation using the largest and most resilient and advanced mobile network infrastructure in the country. Like us, the willingness of these investors to commit substantial capital to this investment reflects continued confidence in the U.K. economy and its commitment to maintain and foster a dynamic and world leading telecommunications sector, as well as a vote of confidence in Europe's plans for a single market in digital communications, leading to increased investment in the telecoms sector."  The CPPIB investment is expected to close in 2016 as it is subject to customary closing conditions, including competition approvals for the transaction between HWL and Telefonica.

Salman Khan Convicted: What will Happen to 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' and 'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo'?!@#Share on linkedin  The 2002 hit-and-run case verdict, in which Salman Khan has been pronounced guilty and sentenced to five years in jail, has not only left the superstar's family and friends devastated, but also got many thinking about the films he was scheduled to wrap up. Salman Khan poses with kids on the sets of 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' Salman Khan/ Instagram Salman Khan poses with kids on the sets of 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' Salman Khan/ Instagram  Kabir Khan's "Bajrangi Bhaijaan" and Sooraj Barjatya's "Prem Ratan Dhan Payo" are two of the most awaited films of the actor, and he was almost there with them when the verdict happened. However, there are chances he might be able to put a full stop on them before he's put behind bars.  "The Court has given its verdict and we have to respect that. I just hope like how Sanjay Dutt got a month to complete his films before he is put behind bars, Salman also gets the same. Both the films are almost 90% complete," Bollywood Life quoted trade expert Akshaye Rathi as saying.  However, he further elaborated that if the High Court sides with the Sessions Court decision, the producers might tweak the stories in order to not let his absence affect the films' release.  "It's a very subjective thing to do. Depends completely on the producers. But given the fact that the climaxes of both the films have been canned, they might give that a try. But that's a long shot," he noted.  Here's what some of the netizens have to say:  Abhi Biswas @aishwarya__14 Court must give salman time to complete the shoot of #BajrangiBhaijaan n #PremRatanDhanPayo #SalmanVerdict.  Ayush Garg: Sooraj Barjatya must file for permission to shoot Prem Ratan Dhan Payo in Arthur Road Jail. Otherwise sign Abhijeet instead. #SalmanVerdict  Charlie Bikash: Prem Ratan Dhan Payo is not complete either. 25% of the shoot still left. Scheduled to release during Diwali 2015 (sic).  naina kapoor: Ab bajrangi bhaijan ka shoot toh khatam ho gaya.but wat abt prem ratan dhan payo?will the court pay for the loss or salman??

Delight in Diversity!@#Tweet  “Diversity: the art of thinking independently together”– Malcolm Forbes  Studies show the correlation between diversity and innovation . Yet Silicon Valley, the cradle of tech innovation, portrays the image of a “bro-grammer” culture where 20-something white guys work in a testosterone-fueled environment to create the next technology revolution. This sends a confusing message to leaders – fostering diversity is good for you in theory, but it is hard work, and it is not how the cool kids do it.  In this blog, I want to make a different argument: Working on a diverse team is delightful! Leaders can use team diversity to enhance their employee engagement.  Let me share with you some examples of delightful diversity in the Design and Co-Innovation Center (DCC) here at SAP.  Geographical Diversity  SAP is a global company, and we work with colleagues and customers all over the world. Even in one location, we have team members from diverse counties of origin. It is not unusual to hear different languages and accents in the hallway.  For example, in the DCC in Palo Alto, we have 25 colleagues who speak 19 languages among us. And this translates to tangible customer value. When assigning team members to projects, we consider languages spoken in addition to domain knowledge, skill set and availability. This diversity enables us to delight the customer in unexpected ways.  Case in point: A few months ago, a customer delegation visited us from Thailand to learn about our design process, and we were able to present to them in Thai. This was a pleasant surprise to the customer who had expected English. The customer’s group appreciated us going the extra mile, and this gesture enabled us to establish a deeper connection to them. Of course, this was only made possible by the multi-lingual nature of our team.  We celebrate our cultural diversity by observing the various regional celebrations during our team meetings. Here are some of our team celebrations from the last two years:  Christmas with German Glühwein (festive wine)  Diwali with mithai sweets  Nowruz (the Persian new year) with Haft Seen (the seven traditional table settings)  Rosh Hashanah with honey and apples  Chinese New Year with red envelopes and chocolate gold coins (similar to Hanukkah gelt)  Chinese moon festival with moon cakes  Thanksgiving cross-cultural potluck  Halloween with costumes and candy  This diversity comes with small inconveniences. When organizing team lunches or dinners, we make it a point to accommodate everyone’s dietary restrictions and preferences -- whether it is someone who is a vegetarian or someone fasting for Ramadan. It is worth the extra step to accommodate our diversity.  Generational Diversity  In the DCC we have team members who are recent university graduates, and those with over two decades of experience. We assign experienced mentors to new employees to accelerate their learning curve. Interestingly, we find the experienced team members learn as much from the new graduates as the other way around. This generational diversity has to be managed carefully, so the experienced employees do not feel threatened or devalued, and the new employees are integrated quickly and start to feel productive.  We foster a culture of team reviews where we openly share our work and invite feedback from peers. Good feedback can come from anyone, regardless of his or her seniority. This reinforces our focus on learning, and it inspires our team every day.  Of course, this generational diversity means we have to be thoughtful in picking team-building activities. To be inclusive, we request the team members to suggest activities, and the team votes to pick a winner. Recently, we went through this process and the activity that won was a graffiti workshop in San Francisco. It took us a few weeks to go through the selection process but it was worth it, since everyone felt included and had a great time.  Gender Diversity  In our team, we don’t entertain any stereotypical view of gender. We have strong women and empathetic men just as we have strong men and empathetic women. What unites us is our love for design and our customer focus. As a female leader, I strive to set a good example by being authentic in my leadership style. Compassion, empathy, professionalism, customer focus and design excellence are values we live by regardless of gender.  Our focus on family benefits all. We have new moms and dads in the team, and people in different stages of life. We consider a team member’s personal commitments and plan project work or travel around it. It adds an additional layer of complexity in planning, but is worth it since it builds strong bonds in the team.  We invite family and friends to visit our beautiful open offices in Palo Alto. We have had our team members’ children, spouses, siblings, parents, in-laws, aunts and uncles stop by. We take the time to show them our work and explain to them what we do. I personally love to do this, since it helps me articulate our message of design innovation in simple words that will resonate with a non-technical audience. We keep our team table stocked with treats such as fruit bars and baked goods, so visitors feel welcome, embodying our team’s empathy and service mindset.  To conclude, working in a diverse team is delightful, and you are missing out if your team is not! If you are inspired to make your team more diverse, check out my next blog Diversity by Design. 202 Views Categories: Future of Work / HR, User Experience Tags none ( add ) Topics: business_trends Tags: innovation , culture , leadership!@#english

Alvopetro Announces Additional Positive Results From 197(2) Well Testing and Acquisition of Remaining 50% Interest in Block 170!@#SYS-CON MEDIA Authors: Liz McMillan , Elizabeth White , Pat Romanski , Judith Hurwitz , David H Deans News Feed Item Alvopetro Announces Additional Positive Results From 197(2) Well Testing and Acquisition of Remaining 50% Interest in Block 170 May 8, 2015 12:50 AM EDT  CALGARY, ALBERTA -- (Marketwired) -- 05/08/15 -- Alvopetro Energy Ltd. (TSX VENTURE: ALV) is pleased to announce the testing results from the third test interval of our 197(2) well and the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Block 170.  197(2) Testing  In December 2014, our 197(2) well located on Block 197 in the Reconcavo basin in the State of Bahia, Brazil, reached a total depth of 1,669 metres, discovered natural gas, and was cased and cemented. Based on logs, the well encountered 78 metres of potential net natural gas pay, with an average 33% water saturation and an average porosity of 12%, using an 8% porosity cut-off. We perforated and completed the deepest sandstone interval, at 1,460 - 1,469 metres, and completed a 72 hour wireline perforated cased-hole test. This average 12.6% porosity interval flowed natural gas, on an unstimulated basis, at an average rate of 101,000 m3/d (3.6 MMcfpd or 600 boepd), with a 32/64" choke, using 2-7/8 inch tubing, from the Caruacu Member of the Maracangalha Formation. The initial pressure transient analysis of this first interval forecasts potential post-stimulation rates at 261,000 m3/d (9.2 MMcfpd or 1,530 boepd) after three months of continuous production and 125,000 m3/d (4.4 MMcfpd or 730 boepd) after one year of continuous production, in both instances at 1,000 psi sandface pressure.  The second test, including the intervals from 1,371 - 1,376 and 1,384 - 1,389 metres, contained 10.5 metres of net pay and 13.6% average porosity. Over the 72 hour tubing conveyed perforated cased-hole test, the second intervals flowed natural gas, on an unstimulated basis, at an average rate of 53,000 m3/d (1.9 MMcfpd or 310 boepd), with a 32/64" choke, using 2-7/8 inch tubing, from the Caruacu Member of the Maracangalha Formation.  The third test of the interval from 1,322 - 1,327 metres, contains 5 metres of net pay and 18% average porosity. Over the 72 hour wireline conveyed perforated cased-hole test, the third interval flowed natural gas, on an unstimulated basis, at an average rate of 89,500 m3/d (3.2 MMcfpd or 527 boepd), with a 48/64" choke, using 2-7/8 inch tubing, from the Caruacu Member of the Maracangalha Formation. At commencement of the third test, the flowing tubing pressure at the wellhead was 1,650 kPa (239 psig) and increased to 1,810 kPa (263 psig) at the end of the test. The initial shut-in casing pressure in the wellbore at commencement of the test was 10,700 kPa (1550 psig) and the ending shut-in casing pressure was 3,010 kPa (437 psig). Cumulatively, over the duration of this 72 hour test, the well produced 269,000 m3 (9.5 MMcf) of natural gas. During the course of this test, in addition to the natural gas and not included in any flow rates reported above, we recovered 25.6 barrels of 62 degrees API condensate and 5 barrels of water.  The 197(2) well is currently shut-in to measure reservoir pressure and obtain pressure build-up data to undertake a pressure transient analysis, which will allow Alvopetro to predict the deliverability of this third interval. The well will be suspended while the flow and build-up data is incorporated into a final completion design.  Block 170 Acquisition CIO, CTO & Developer Resources  During 2014, we focused significant effort on reprocessing and interpreting our extensive 3D seismic database, enabling us to expand our 9-prospect inventory of conventional exploration opportunities to an 18-prospect inventory. One of our more prospective conventional oil exploration opportunities is a shallower target on Block 170, at 2,000 metres vertical depth, that we plan to drill in the second half of 2015.  Alvopetro has acquired the remaining working interest in Block 170 subject to Brazil's National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels ("ANP") approval. Prior to the acquisition, Alvopetro had a commitment to pay 100% of the cost of a well drilled to the Gomo Formation (3,200 metres vertical depth) to retain a 90% interest in the Gomo Formation and a 50% interest in all formations above the Gomo. This acquisition allows us to significantly reduce our capital commitments on Block 170 by drilling a shallower well and to retain 100% of the upside associated with this high priority prospect.  Alvopetro Energy Ltd.'s vision is to be the premier independent exploration and production company in Brazil, maximizing shareholder value by applying innovation to underexploited opportunities, while maintaining our focus on being a low cost operator. Our strategy is to pursue development of our highly prospective land base with a three-pronged approach targeting lower risk development drilling on our mature fields, shallow conventional exploration opportunities, and the development of the significant hydrocarbon potential present in our deep Gomo resource play. Alvopetro's strong financial position, along with our exceptionally talented technical team, local operating capabilities, and highly prospective land base, position us to successfully develop our assets.

Test Results. Any references in this news release to test results, production from testing and performance rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however, such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such well will continue production and decline thereafter. Test results are not necessarily indicative of long-term performance of the relevant well or fields or of ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons.  Abbreviations: m3 = cubic metre m3/d = cubic metre per day Mcfpd = thousand cubic feet per day MMcf = million cubic feet MMcfpd = million cubic feet per day Boepd = barrels of oil equivalent per day kPa = kilopascals (103) psig = pounds per square inch gauge mD = millidarcies degrees API = degrees API (American Petroleum Institute)  BOE Disclosure. The term barrels of oil equivalent ("boe") may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet per barrel (6mcf/bbl) of natural gas to barrels of oil equivalence is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. All boe conversions in this press release are derived from converting gas to oil in the ratio mix of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil.

Alvopetro Announces Additional Positive Results From 197(2) Well Testing and Acquisition of Remaining 50% Interest in Block 170!@#SYS-CON MEDIA Authors: Liz McMillan , Elizabeth White , Pat Romanski , Judith Hurwitz , David H Deans News Feed Item Alvopetro Announces Additional Positive Results From 197(2) Well Testing and Acquisition of Remaining 50% Interest in Block 170 May 8, 2015 12:49 AM EDT  CALGARY, ALBERTA -- (Marketwired) -- 05/08/15 -- Alvopetro Energy Ltd. (TSX VENTURE:ALV) is pleased to announce the testing results from the third test interval of our 197(2) well and the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Block 170.  197(2) Testing  In December 2014, our 197(2) well located on Block 197 in the Reconcavo basin in the State of Bahia, Brazil, reached a total depth of 1,669 metres, discovered natural gas, and was cased and cemented. Based on logs, the well encountered 78 metres of potential net natural gas pay, with an average 33% water saturation and an average porosity of 12%, using an 8% porosity cut-off. We perforated and completed the deepest sandstone interval, at 1,460 - 1,469 metres, and completed a 72 hour wireline perforated cased-hole test. This average 12.6% porosity interval flowed natural gas, on an unstimulated basis, at an average rate of 101,000 m3/d (3.6 MMcfpd or 600 boepd), with a 32/64" choke, using 2-7/8 inch tubing, from the Caruacu Member of the Maracangalha Formation. The initial pressure transient analysis of this first interval forecasts potential post-stimulation rates at 261,000 m3/d (9.2 MMcfpd or 1,530 boepd) after three months of continuous production and 125,000 m3/d (4.4 MMcfpd or 730 boepd) after one year of continuous production, in both instances at 1,000 psi sandface pressure.  The second test, including the intervals from 1,371 - 1,376 and 1,384 - 1,389 metres, contained 10.5 metres of net pay and 13.6% average porosity. Over the 72 hour tubing conveyed perforated cased-hole test, the second intervals flowed natural gas, on an unstimulated basis, at an average rate of 53,000 m3/d (1.9 MMcfpd or 310 boepd), with a 32/64" choke, using 2-7/8 inch tubing, from the Caruacu Member of the Maracangalha Formation.  The third test of the interval from 1,322 - 1,327 metres, contains 5 metres of net pay and 18% average porosity. Over the 72 hour wireline conveyed perforated cased-hole test, the third interval flowed natural gas, on an unstimulated basis, at an average rate of 89,500 m3/d (3.2 MMcfpd or 527 boepd), with a 48/64" choke, using 2-7/8 inch tubing, from the Caruacu Member of the Maracangalha Formation. At commencement of the third test, the flowing tubing pressure at the wellhead was 1,650 kPa (239 psig) and increased to 1,810 kPa (263 psig) at the end of the test. The initial shut-in casing pressure in the wellbore at commencement of the test was 10,700 kPa (1550 psig) and the ending shut-in casing pressure was 3,010 kPa (437 psig). Cumulatively, over the duration of this 72 hour test, the well produced 269,000 m3 (9.5 MMcf) of natural gas. During the course of this test, in addition to the natural gas and not included in any flow rates reported above, we recovered 25.6 barrels of 62 degrees API condensate and 5 barrels of water.  The 197(2) well is currently shut-in to measure reservoir pressure and obtain pressure build-up data to undertake a pressure transient analysis, which will allow Alvopetro to predict the deliverability of this third interval. The well will be suspended while the flow and build-up data is incorporated into a final completion design.  Block 170 Acquisition CIO, CTO & Developer Resources  During 2014, we focused significant effort on reprocessing and interpreting our extensive 3D seismic database, enabling us to expand our 9-prospect inventory of conventional exploration opportunities to an 18-prospect inventory. One of our more prospective conventional oil exploration opportunities is a shallower target on Block 170, at 2,000 metres vertical depth, that we plan to drill in the second half of 2015.  Alvopetro has acquired the remaining working interest in Block 170 subject to Brazil's National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels ("ANP") approval. Prior to the acquisition, Alvopetro had a commitment to pay 100% of the cost of a well drilled to the Gomo Formation (3,200 metres vertical depth) to retain a 90% interest in the Gomo Formation and a 50% interest in all formations above the Gomo. This acquisition allows us to significantly reduce our capital commitments on Block 170 by drilling a shallower well and to retain 100% of the upside associated with this high priority prospect.  Alvopetro Energy Ltd.'s vision is to be the premier independent exploration and production company in Brazil, maximizing shareholder value by applying innovation to underexploited opportunities, while maintaining our focus on being a low cost operator. Our strategy is to pursue development of our highly prospective land base with a three-pronged approach targeting lower risk development drilling on our mature fields, shallow conventional exploration opportunities, and the development of the significant hydrocarbon potential present in our deep Gomo resource play. Alvopetro's strong financial position, along with our exceptionally talented technical team, local operating capabilities, and highly prospective land base, position us to successfully develop our assets.  Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.  Test Results. Any references in this news release to test results, production from testing and performance rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however, such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such well will continue production and decline thereafter. Test results are not necessarily indicative of long-term performance of the relevant well or fields or of ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons.  Abbreviations: m3 = cubic metre m3/d = cubic metre per day Mcfpd = thousand cubic feet per day MMcf = million cubic feet MMcfpd = million cubic feet per day Boepd = barrels of oil equivalent per day kPa = kilopascals (103) psig = pounds per square inch gauge mD = millidarcies degrees API = degrees API (American Petroleum Institute)  BOE Disclosure. The term barrels of oil equivalent ("boe") may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet per barrel (6mcf/bbl) of natural gas to barrels of oil equivalence is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. All boe conversions in this press release are derived from converting gas to oil in the ratio mix of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil.
