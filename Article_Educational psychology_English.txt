The Future of the Affordable Care Act and Implications for U.S. Competitiveness!@#No Need to Declare War Against Our Current Enemy  Congress is now debating President Obamas proposed Authorization for the Use of Limited Military Force to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Yet the presidents request for this action from Congress comes more than six months after U.S. aircraft began bombing ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria, and even if passed it is merely an authorization for the use of force, not a full-fledged state of war, which Congress has not passed since World War II.

However, this paradigm change has not yet arrived in German General Practice. We have evaluated the effect of an educational outreach visit with general practitioners (GPs), encouraging them to consider CVR in treatment decisions for patients with hypertension. Methods Prospective cluster-randomised trial comprising 3443 patients with known hypertension treated by 87 GPs. Practices were randomly assigned to complex (A) or simple (B) intervention. Both groups received a guideline by mail; group A also received complex peer intervention promoting the concept of global CVR. Clinical data were collected at baseline and 6-9 months after intervention. Main outcome was improvement of calculated CVR in the predefined subpopulation of patients with a high CVR (10-year mortality ≥5%), but no manifest cardiovascular disease. Results Adjusted for baseline the follow-up CVR were 13.1% (95% CI 12.6%-13.6%) (A) and 12.6% (95% CI 12.2%-13.1%) (B) with a group difference (A vs. B) of 0.5% (-0.2%-1.1%), p = 0.179. The group difference was -0.05% in patients of GPs familiar with global CVR and 1.1% in patients of GPs not familiar with with global CVR. However, this effect modification was not significant (p = 0.165). Pooled over groups, the absolute CVR reduction from baseline was 1.0%, p < 0.001. The ICC was 0.026 (p = 0.002). Hypertension control (BP <140/90 mmHg) improved in the same subpopulation from 38.1 to 45.9% in the complex intervention group, and from 35.6 to 46.5% in the simple intervention group, with adjusted follow-up control rates of 46.7% (95% CI 40.4%-53.1%) (A) and 46.9% (95% CI 40.3%-53.5% (B) and an adjusted odds ratio (A vs B) of 0.99 (95% CI 0.68-1.45), p = 0.966. Conclusions Our complex educational intervention, including a clinical outreach visit, had no significant effect on CVR of patients with known hypertension at high risk compared to a simple postal intervention.

Giving Baltimore the Freedom to Choose the Future It Deserves Tweet  The violence in Baltimore has left many wondering what can be done to improve the lives of young Americans growing up in the inner city, where the path often leads to the unemployment line or worse. Education reform — and school choice, in particular — is an emerging policy option that is drawing growing support from across the political spectrum. Though Baltimore has school choice options, more opportunities for the city's students are needed.  Education activist Jeanne Allen tweeted that "Baltimore riots and community dysfunction remind us that we must fix school and make #edreform a reality 4 all. #Charterschools save cities." The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer stated on Fox News Channel that American inner cities have "the worst schools on earth" and noted, "If you can't improve the schools, give the kids a choice to go to better schools."  The idea of school choice was introduced in 1955 by Nobel Prize winner and libertarian economist Milton Friedman and developed more fully in his book "Free to Choose." Though Friedman favored a completely private educational system, he saw the voucher system as a positive step away from the inherently flawed government system. At its core is the notion that every child deserves a high-quality education and every parent deserves to choose where and how his or her child receives it.  The various options (vouchers, education savings accounts, scholarships funded by tax credits, and individual tax breaks) all come with pros and cons, but the fundamental point is that parents should be allowed to extract their kids from failing public schools and enroll them in the institution of their choice — an option that wealthier parents already possess.  Baltimore would appear to be a prime candidate for greater school choice. Its unemployment rate is 8.4 percent, which is well above the state of Maryland's rate of 5.4 percent. And testing scores show that the system is failing too many children. Columnist Terry Jeffrey noted that in 2013, "only 16 percent of the eighth graders in the Baltimore City Public Schools scored at or above grade-level proficient in the NAEP reading test. That same year, only 13 percent of the eighth graders in the Baltimore City Public Schools scored at or above grade-level proficient in math." Those figures "were lower than the national public school averages, lower than the Maryland averages, and lower than the averages for the nation's large cities." This dismal achievement is not for lack of funding. In the 2014-15 school year, Baltimore's 188 city schools and programs will have spent $1.34 billion, including about $140 million from the federal government, for an enrollment of 84,976 students. That's approximatively $16,000 per pupil. According to Census Bureau data (2012 data are the most recent), that level of per-pupil spending would be second only to New York City among the 100 largest districts nationwide by enrollment.  Students and parents in Baltimore deserve better. Reached by email, Neil McCluskey, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Educational Freedom, told me, "The evidence is clear that private school choice would provide as good or better academic results for a fraction of what Baltimore currently spends." He did caution, however, that "it is also quite clear that what a child experiences outside of school — poverty, broken families, etc. — has more impact on education than what schools themselves do."  Though it would not be a silver bullet, expanding private school choice in Baltimore — as is successfully occurring in other cities around the country — would give parents the incentive to play a more active role in their kids' education and give these children a better shot at escaping the poverty and violence that surround them.

Urban poor!@#FOR the first time in history, more people live in cities than villages, resulting in new challenges to sustainable development. Suddenly it is urban people, often surrounded by wealth, that do not have access to basic rights. In the developing world, one-third of urban residents live in slums – about 860 million people. This number could to grow to over one billion by 2020. This provides new challenges to development, says a new report released by Save the Children. It also points out Sri Lanka is one of the best places in South Asia to be a mother but insists around the world more and more people living in slums are losing the fight of lead healthy lives. The 16th annual State of the World’s Mothers report, which delves into a comparison of the health disparities between wealthy and poor women and children living in cities around the world, ranked Sri Lanka and the Maldives at 92 among 179 countries. The five indicators in the 2015 Mothers’ Index are: the lifetime risk of maternal death; children’s well-being as measured by their under-five mortality rate; educational status, as measured by children’s expected years of formal schooling; economic status, as measured by gross national income per capita; and political status, measured by women’s participation in national government. According to the report, women in Sri Lanka face a one in 1,400 risk of maternal death from pregnancy-related causes while 9.6 children in 1000 die before their fifth birthday. In South Asia, Nepal ranked 114, Bhutan at 122, Bangladesh at 130 in the index while India ranked at 140 and Pakistan at 149. Afghanistan ranked the worst in South Asia at 152. Urbanisation can have a positive or a negative impact on health. Infrastructure improvements such as better access to health services, education, sanitation and safe water supply that often accompany urbanisation can improve health. But if urbanisation is unplanned and rapid, it is prone to producing informal settlements with insufficient housing, poor sanitary conditions and crowding, all of which can accelerate the spread of diseases and lead to a worsening health status. The research suggests urban population growth in developing countries has done and may continue to do both. In general, nations that have high life expectancies and low mortality rates are highly urbanised. These are countries where city governments invest in sound policies. The improvements over the last 50+ years in mortality and morbidity rates in highly urbanised countries like Japan, Sweden, the Netherlands and Singapore are testimony to the potentially health-promoting features of modern cities. But rapid and disorganised urbanisation can also lead to higher rates of under-5 mortality. This is especially true in low- and middle income countries when rapid urbanisation is combined with poor economic performance, poor governance, failure of national and urban housing policies, and institutional and legal failure. For example, recent research from Nigeria found that the urban child mortality rate increased with urban population growth. The increase in deaths was linked to more people living in slum-like conditions than being removed from assistance. The report calls on Governments to promote universal health coverage, develop comprehensive and cross-sectoral urban plans and mobilise excessive resources to deprived urban areas. Sri Lanka as a developing country has to take these aspects into consideration when utilising urban planning. In a fast transitioning world, the poorest are now right under our collective noses.!@#english
!@#Quote: : Wonder how many special-ed students they have? Or English-language learners, or socio-economically challenged families, or students who are far below basic skill levels, or...? Being a public school employee, I won't object to many of the criticisms leveled at public education, however, when you're working under a governmental mandate that ALL students have the right to an equal educational experience, the noble sentiments of education expressed in the article come crashing back to reality. It's hard to look at a situation where you appear to have rather affluent students and parents who are undoubtedly involved (they wouldn't put their kids in a place like that if they weren't serious about education) and draw any meaningful conclusions or applications that can be applied to the greater public. FWIW, there is no school that a 7-year old would attend in California that would come close to have 38 students (high 20s at the most), and the "endless bubble-filled tests" took most of our classes (only grades 3-5 were taking it this year) less than a week to complete with the new computerized adapting-difficulty tests.!@#english

!@#Quote: : I would also add that schools tend to be way too liberal-minded when it comes to how they treat students. What I mean is that they no longer value or reward achievement...they value equality and self-esteem. Not that those things don't have their place but they've superseded the value of actually being the best at math, English, or whatever subject that used to give kids a feeling of accomplishment. It's very rare for a school to hold a kid back a year because they aren't capable of going to the next grade...they hold them back if they miss way too many days sometimes, or if there are behavioral issues, but never for under-performance or failure to understand the material. Students then go to the next grade level, can't understand the material, slow down the entire class while the teacher tries to keep them up to speed, and everyone suffers. All those idiotic 'my child is a star student' bumper stickers are handed out by turns in many schools, so that each kid gets one during the school year so their self esteem doesn't suffer. It makes the award meaningless...like the 100 meter dash at the special olympics. Everyone gets a medal but who really wins? What's the point of training, practicing, or improving if everyone gets the same reward in the end? Kids know that and the ones who might be capable of achieving something just don't see why it matters anymore, so not as many of them are willing to put in the extra work. Schools like this one are not the answer because they're exclusive...we have schools, we have teacher, and we have books, technology and other things needed to educate...we just need to change the mindset of educators in general to teach, encourage, reward accomplishment, and discourage failure by having meaningful consequences. In much of this, schools are merely a reflection of the society and culture which they are serving. Believe me, nobody would rather see us reward and celebrate achievement, and enforce accountability of students to knowing the material and completing the work, than teachers. Public education is handcuffed partially by its system and bureaucracy, but also in large part because society has expected them to be the sole educational (and, in some cases, parental) influence in a child's life. Schools and districts have also been litigated into submission on any point in which they strive to hold students to a reasonable standard or level of expectation.!@#english

Dad’s reply to school on kids’ absence is best response ever!@#Posted Today, 11:57 AM Earlier this month, Philadelphia-area dad Mike Rossi pulled his two kids out of school for a few days so they could watch him run the Boston Marathon. The father of two elementary aged children proved to be the real MVP when he replied to a letter from his children’s school that said they were not accepting a family trip to Boston as an excusable absence. Michael Rossi took to Facebook to share the letter he received from Rochelle S. Marbury, Principal of Rydal Elementary School after his kids Jack and Victoria missed April 17, 20 and 21, 2015. The letter from the principal stated this: “Dear Mr. and Mrs. Rossi,” the letter read, “I understand your family recently took a family vacation. I want you to be aware that the Abington School District does not recognize family trips as an excused absence, regardless of the activities involved in the trip. The school district is not in the position of overseeing family vacations or evaluating the educational nature of a family trip. The dates that your children were absent were recorded as unexcused. An accumulation of unexcused absences can result in a referral to our attendance officer and a subsequent notice of a violation of the compulsory school attendance law.” Mr. Rossi served a hot cup of tea back, validating why he took his children with him and explained how he turned the “vacation” into a field trip that allowed them to walk through historical places their classmates have yet to learn about. Plus, he allowed them to witness the resilience of #BostonStrong. After learning that the main purpose of the trip had to do with the death of a loved one, it sort of made me wonder if the person who drafted the letter doesn’t consider compassionate days for kids also. But, with one month left in the school year, Jack and Victoria have earned so much more than a grade – they’ve earned bragging rights for having a father who has lessons that are far from the confines of a classroom #Parentoftheyear! MICHAEL ROSSI’S RESPONSE TO SCHOOL: Dear Madam Principal, While I appreciate your concern for our children’s education, I can promise you they learned as much in the five days we were in Boston as they would in an entire year in school. Our children had a once-in-a-lifetime experience, one that can’t be duplicated in a classroom or read in a book. In the 3 days of school they missed (which consisted of standardized testing that they could take any time) they learned about dedication, commitment, love, perseverance, overcoming adversity, civic pride, patriotism, American history culinary arts and physical education. They watched their father overcome, injury, bad weather, the death of a loved one and many other obstacles to achieve an important personal goal. They also experienced first-hand the love and support of thousands of others cheering on people with a common goal. At the marathon, they watched blind runners, runners with prosthetic limbs and debilitating diseases and people running to raise money for great causes run in the most prestigious and historic marathon in the world. They also paid tribute to the victims of a senseless act of terrorism and learned that no matter what evil may occur, terrorists can not deter the American spirit. These are things they won’t ever truly learn in the classroom. In addition our children walked the Freedom Trail, visited the site of the Boston Tea Party, the Boston Massacre and the graves of several signers of the Declaration of Independence. These are things they WILL learn in school a year or more from now. So in actuality our children are ahead of the game. They also visited an aquarium, sampled great cuisine and spent many hours of physical activity walking and swimming. We appreciate the efforts of the wonderful teachers and staff and cherish the education they are receiving at Rydal Elementary School. We truly love our school. But I wouldn’t hesitate to pull them out of school again for an experience like the one they had this past week. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Michael Rossi Father!@#english
!@#Quote: : Participation is key. Paying 20 a year to be in a club will keep it going but it will eventually fail.. Exactly! Paying your yearly membership fees and not bothering to participate in the club does it no good. Quote: : I just wanted to add my 2¢. If it was not for C-Sea I would not have the tank I have today. When I first started in saltwater I found this site first, and was intimidated by some of the members who's advice was their way or your tank will fail. It was not until I found C-Sea that I had a supportive group who helped me make my tank work. With CRSWA that is what I want the main mission to be, a friendly supportive group of like minded people. I did not start CRSWA because I had an issue with C-Sea or how it operated, but instead I saw a need for a group for people further south. Thank you for giving my point some validity! I'm glad CRSWA started and seems to be going well. I realize that Akron and the surrounding area is a bit far for participation in a Cleveland club and it's nice to see something for people that live in that area. Well done, and carry on. Quote: : I have been to two Csea meetings in the past year one at the zoo with the reef rock presentation the other at Triton Marine. Not being an active member in along time I found both meetings to have some educational value, but lacking in personality or comraderie. The one at the zoo lacked even a cup of water for the length of the meeting. Trident lacked the the size and seating for a comfortable experince. I know it sounds petty but it is an important consideration from my wifes and I view point. The other meetings were farther than I cared to go and return to home at 11 or 11:30 possibily with an animal that would need to be aclimated for another hour unless of course we did not participate in the club raffle. I know this post is very me oriented but it is how I feel. I will be rejoining the club probably at this next meeting because I believe the club should be supported and continue it's mission for future reefers. I get what you are saying about the social aspects of the current club, but you have to remember that it's a bunch of new people and that sort of thing doesn't happen in one or two meetings. When people show up on a regular basis, they inevitably get to know each other. If the vast majority of people only show for a meeting or two a year, the camaraderie will not develop. I try to talk to every person that attends a meeting, I know not everyone is that social, but everyone there has a common interest that they can talk about to each other! I understand that refreshments used to be at every meeting, this was before my time in the club. I typically bring a bottle of water to tide me over. If this is the hurtle that is keeping you from attending I'm not sure what to tell you. We tried something new this year and held meetings at the various stores that sponsor us. These stores are not setup to seat a lot, or in some cases, any people. If standing causes significant discomfort to your wife and she wants to attend, please contact myself or another BOD member privately in advance of a meeting and we will do our best to accommodate her if we are holding the meeting in a place not designed for seats.!@#english

During final approach to the runway, the airplane drifted to the left. The left main landing gear was off the pavement at touch down, and the airplane pivoted to the left. The student attempted a go-around. As he pulled back on the yoke during takeoff, the left wing stalled, and the nose gear hit the ground. The airplane spun around 180° before coming to a stop, resulting in substantial damage. The student was not hurt. The student reported that the wind was calm just before the landing. The NTSB determined the probable cause as the student pilot’s failure to maintain adequate airspeed during the go-around attempt, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and collision with the ground. NTSB Identification: ERA13CA235 This May 2013 accident report is provided by the National Transportation Safety Board . Published as an educational tool, it is intended to help pilots learn from the misfortunes of others.!@#english

RACE School districts spending millions on white privilege training for employees!@#School districts spending millions on white privilege training for employees Wow!... Our school district just had to lay of a lot of teachers and cut a bunch of programs. I sure hope it's not to pay for crap like this. According to PEG, white culture is based on white individualism or white traits like rugged individualism, adherence to rigid time schedules, planning for the future, and the idea that hard work is the key to success. Minority students shouldnt be expected to subscribe to those values because they are foreign to their culture, according to PEG. http://eagnews.org/school-districts-...for-employees/ SAN FRANCISCO  The Pacific Educational Group (PEG) espouses a lot of controversial and stereotypical concepts regarding minority students in K-12 schools. For instance, the organization teaches that black kids are less likely to respond to fundamental ideas like working hard to achieve success, or being on time for school or work, because those ideas are supposedly foreign to African-American culture. PEG is literally selling notions like that to American public schools, and the schools are buying them, at a cost of millions of tax dollars every year. One prominent black professional, journalist and author Juan Williams, thinks those schools are subscribing to a politically-driven philosophy that grossly underestimates the capabilities of minority students, particularly black children. These people (associated with PEG) are engaged in cultural, political arguments that are based on negative stereotypes of black capacity to achieve in any situation, Williams said. My mother never would have said, You dont have to be on time. If you are then you are acting white. That idea is tragically insulting. EAGnews recently obtained a partial list of American school districts that contract with San Francisco-based PEG for educational consulting services. Most of those services come in the form of workshops for teachers and other staff members. Forty-two districts on that list responded to an EAGnews request for information about how much they have paid PEG over the past five years. The total amount was $3.9 million between 2010 and 2015, with some districts spending a lot more than others. The biggest spender on the list was Pittsburgh Public Schools, which paid PEG a whopping $586,300 over a four-year period. The districts initial investment was $231,000 in the 2010-11 school year. It spent $96,100 the following year, then $183,200 in 2012-13 and $76,000 in 2013-14. Then theres the Osseo, Minnesota school district, which has paid PEG $533,800 over the past three years. It started with a $100,000 payment in the 2012-13 school year, followed by $225,000 in 2013-14 and $208,800 in 2014-15 The other top PEG spenders on the list are Baltimore County Public Schools ($427,000), Lawrence Public Schools in Kansas ($362,750), Talbot County Public Schools in Maryland ($259,100) and the Bellevue School District in Washington ($237,100, including $153,600 in 2014-15). What are the educators in these districts learning in exchange for all of that money? The PEG message is centered on the concept of white privilege and the detrimental impact it supposedly has on minority students. On a basic level, PEG teaches that minority students dont do as well as white students on the average because traditional American education is structured around white cultural norms, which are frequently difficult for minority students to grasp . Reasonable people might see value in that idea. It makes sense for teachers and other educators to be more aware of the various cultural influences and traditions that shape the mentality of their students. But many people believe PEG goes overboard with the concept, to an alarming degree. Many of the organizations messages seem to suggest that minority kids are incapable of learning and succeeding unless K-12 curriculum is specifically customized for them. When I came here the teachers really did believe that they were doing the best job for the population that they worked with, Sharon Brittingham, a school principal, told a 2010 white privilege conference in Wisconsin, which PEG helped organize. But what had to change was that belief that these children could learn at high levels of expectations. Teachers are actually encouraged by PEG to segregate children by race. PEG doesnt put it quite that bluntly, but it does instruct teachers to identify focus students, adding that it is preferable for all the students to be of the same racial group. Teachers are also taught that they should have separate behavior expectations for minority students, because those students supposedly come from cultures with radically different values. For instance, one of the annual white privilege conferences in Wisconsin taught participants that minority kids frequently have a different value and view on time, missed days, working together, and wait time between questions and answers. It tells teachers to be flexible with minority students who are persistently late or miss a lot of school days. It also tells teachers to be tolerant if black children exhibit an exuberant participation style of shouting out answers and questions. According to PEG, white culture is based on white individualism or white traits like rugged individualism, adherence to rigid time schedules, plan(ning) for the future, and the idea that hard work is the key to success. Minority students shouldnt be expected to subscribe to those values because they are foreign to their culture, according to PEG. Williams strongly disagrees. The tradition of black Americans throughout history is one that values the opportunity for education, Williams said. That includes being on time and working hard in school. You wont find a black mother or father who says thats not our tradition. Were all in the same American culture. In any job you have to be on time. Thats just the way the world works. These people are engaged in cultural and political arguments that are based on negative stereotypes of black capacity to achieve in any situation. They are not helping these kids.!@#english
!@#Well at our last staff meeting we were told that next fall we would be having training in "Restorative Justice". I almost threw up! From what I have read about it, the main factor of childhood failure in school is not addressed. And that is having a functional healthy with it parental unit/s. Who support their child behaving, learning, eating well, and doing their job. Relying on the government to "parent" students means, that your child will be subject to the whims and political agenda of the school district and the educational staff and administration.

Here's one of the myths that seems to have gotten short shrift: Myth #4: A Successful Program Works Everywhere There is significant evidence against the idea that a program successful in one school or district should be imported elsewhere and expected to work well. Context is the key variable. Programs must be related to the makeup of the school district and/or the specific school. Approaches to education that are marketed for nationwide use may be excellent yet totally inappropriate for some districts. A program has to fit the specific needs of the schools and classrooms in the district, and a careful needs assessment coupled with a thorough examination should determine whether to adopt a program, not the success of the program elsewhere.

!@#Re: IRS wasted $5.6B on bogus Obama stimulus tax credits: Audit Originally Posted by MickeyW IRS wasted $5.6B on bogus Obama stimulus tax credits: Audit - Washington Times The IRS doled out more than $5 billion in potentially bogus college aid payments under an Obama stimulus tax credit in 2012, according to a new report Tuesday from the agency’s inspector general that said the administration still doesn’t have a good handle on how to root out erroneous claims. More than 3.8 million students received more than $5.6 billion in questionable tax credits, the audit found — more than half of those never filed their tuition statement, while others were paid tax credits even though the schools they attended weren’t acceptable institutions. Read more: IRS wasted $5.6B on bogus Obama stimulus tax credits: Audit - Washington Times Follow us: @washtimes on Twitter Whenever anyone sees the Washington Times as the source, it must be taken with a grain of salt. Therefore, I went to Accounting Today to verify the story. The issue seems to be that millions of people are claiming these credits, that Congress passed, and the IRS doesn't have a good method to determine whether the credits are valid. According to Accounting Today : Holland observed that the IRS has worked with the Treasury Department to address the challenges that need to be overcome before significant improvement can be made in stopping erroneous claims for education credits. “Requests have been submitted for legislative changes that would enable the IRS to use internal and other governmental databases to validate student eligibility and, when students are found to be ineligible, to remove the credit outside of deficiency procedures,” she wrote. “Requests have also been submitted to simplify the educational credit landscape and to accelerate the filing due date for information returns, including Form 1098-T, to January 31.” An IRS spokesperson emailed Accounting Today a further response to the report from the agency. “The IRS has taken a number of steps to protect these important credits, including making changes to a key form in 2012 that reduced the number of claims by $4.5 billion in one year,” said the IRS. “IRS efforts in this area are hampered by the complexity of laws affecting education credits. Congress could help by approving legislative proposals that would give the IRS new tools to access other government databases to validate student eligibility and help disallow the credits more easily. Congress could also simplify educational credits and accelerate the filing date for informational returns like the Form 1098-T to the IRS.” " I never meant to say that the Conservatives are generally stupid. I meant to say that stupid people are generally Conservative. I believe that is so obviously and universally admitted a principle that I hardly think any gentleman will deny it." --J.S.

Round about this time, we ought to have been chilling our champagne an!@#Round about this time, we ought to have been chilling our champagne and getting ready to exult in, and celebrate, a year of dramatic and positive change under the inspiring leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Vision, vim, vigour, and vitality should have been the keywords for Year One of the Modi Era. Yet the mood is rather subdued. The Bharatiya Janata Party, despite record membership, has not fared all that well in a string of by-elections and local polls, the latest being the clean sweep by Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress in West Bengal’ municipalities. The opposition seems to have coalesced, at least in parliament, although the motley Janata groups may not remain united. Rahul Gandhi has got the Congress party rearing up from its tired shanks, although the horse may not last the stretch. In this noise and tumult, both the land acquisition and goods and services tax bills look to be stalled in the upper house. The biggest change over the past year is that euphoria has made way for realism. It was never going to be easy steering a nation this large, diverse and fractious on a purely economic route, although Modi won power a year ago on the promise of universal development (Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas). There have been plenty of distractions. By month-end Modi will be the most-travelled world leader this past year: he will complete 19 trips abroad, staying out a total of 55 days (nearly the same length as Rahul Gandhi’s absence, although taxpayers got far better returns). So foreign policy is a thumping success. Domestically there is a lot of grinding and gnashing about diversionary issues: Muslim and Christian scaremongering, cultural-historical and educational cleansing, language chauvinism, and the frantic adoption of every icon the government can lay its hands on, the likes of Vallabhbhai Patel and Babasaheb Ambedkar. The dash to woo the Dalit vote glosses over a key fact: late in his life Ambedkar, fed up of the prejudices and bigotry he had struggled against, repudiated Hinduism and embraced Buddhism. In a May 1950 conversation he explained to the writer Mulk Raj Anand (whose novel Untouchable we must all read): “I have felt that through the faith of the Buddha which does not believe in the Hindu God Brahma, (one) can aspire to be (a) human being, free of dogmas, obscure myths and legends! One can pursue knowledge! One can disown casteist heroes of the Hindus like king Ram, Avtar of Vishnu Bhagwan!” Poor Narendra Modi. He came into office with a great advantage as India’s first Twitter prime minister. He has over 12 million followers now; I just read that he gained an astonishing 280,498 new ones on just one day, April 7, which was a mundane, uneventful day. But he is now being blamed for not being communicative enough. Will his history be stitched together from 140-character thoughtbursts, or is he going to mark his first anniversary with some clear, unambiguous replies to critics who say things, especially on the economic front, haven’t gone far enough fast enough? Although Modi took an unkind swipe at his predecessors in Toronto last month when boasting that Scam India was moving towards Skill India, and although the odour of corruption and mis-governance has lifted noticeably, something is holding investor sentiment in check. Maybe it is the tax bloodhounds smelling new game, or the entrepreneur who feels that it is not time just yet to set up that mammoth factory to churn out millions of widgets, or the exporter whose cash register is not clanging. Whatever, it took an in-house critic like Arun Shourie to take the Modi Sarkar behind the woodshed last week. Modi just cannot afford to take Shourie lightly. After all, the former editor, economist and author’s April 1996 essay on Hindutva is reproduced in full on the BJP’s website to explain its philosophy of “cultural nationalism”. Shourie’s column followed a Supreme Court ruling of December 1995 that said Hindutva does not necessarily refer to religious practices but as “the way of life of the Indian people”. After all, in August 2013 Shourie stoutly defended Modi, again in an interview to Karan Thapar, calling his rivals like Sushma Swaraj and L.K. Advani “stateless leaders”. And after all, in August 2009, Shourie had lashed out against the BJP’s then leadership after its second successive general election loss to the Congress party, calling it a “kati patang” (a kite without a string) and describing party chief Rajnath Singh, now Modi’s aHome Minister, as “Alice in Blunderland”. He urged the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the BJP’s patron organisation, to drum sense into the party’s bickering leadership. “RSS should crack the whip,” Shourie said then. So this time around when government ministers criticised Shourie, some implying that it was a case of sour grapes because he had not been granted any official post, Modi himself stayed significantly silent. What signal did he see behind Shourie’s outburst? One of the ministers who leapt to Modi’s defence was Piyush Goyal, who heads the key ministries of power, coal and new and renewable energy. One of the brightest younger members of Modi’s cabinet, a former BJP treasurer and investment banker, Goyal’s achievements somewhat refute Shourie’s criticism. Over the past year, Goyal told me, his government has added a record 22,500 MW of power-generating capacity and crossed one billion units of electricity generation. India’s coal production grew 8.3 per cent in 2014/15, the highest in 23 years. Goyal is aiming at 100,000 MW of solar power and 60,000 MW of wind power by 2022 — targets that seem almost dizzyingly difficult. The controversial 204 coal mining blocks cancelled by the Supreme Court are being auctioned off, and Goyal says he expects revenue of up to Rs 192,000 crore from the e-auctions of just the first 29 blocks to go to private bidders. Shourie Quote: d a newspaper analysis to charge that the government had hyped its revenue projections, which would only accrue over 30 years of full production by the auctioned coal mines. Be that as it may, Modi and his cabinet are very likely to roll out a bunch of e-books, which the prime minister favours, listing their achievements since taking office. That, too, was pooh-poohed by Shourie, who said during his May Day fusillade: “Every government at any time can give you a long list.” Withering words. In the end, perceptions matter and the voter is king. Indeed, late in 2013, with Modi’s shadow looming large over it, the Congress-led government had put out an impressive, eight-page list of its own achievements over just two years. Did that win it re-election?!@#english
!@#Quote: : I think that's correct if the pace is far enough out of context. But if it's just a little off, it might take a few more moments to realized it. For example, if the right beat is 120bpm and you hear it at 140 or 80, you're gonna realize real quick. If it's 124 or 112, you might not grasp it at first, but it will feel 'off.' Cheers Ghostman, The movie suggests that if the right beat is 120bpm, but the drummer starts out at 120.27 bpm, a person could determine that in about 1.4 seconds. Seems unrealistic to me, but then I'm not a professional. And it's only a movie. The thing is, it brought up the question in my mind: how 'close' are some of the members here to tempo exactness? Meanwhile, we have been using the metronome recently: it's educational for sure. With some songs, two or three bpm make a big difference to how it grooves. I find this is more true with slow songs. Also, contra what is in that movie, I will need to listen to LOTS of bars played before I have an opinion about whether the tempo is good for us.!@#english

A freind sent this to me and I had the share!@#A freind sent this to me and I had the share Most people don't know that back in 1912, Hellmann's Mayonnaise was manufactured in England. In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. ... But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning. The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5 and is known, of course, as - Sinko De Mayo. WHAT???

Arizona Boxing News & Notes With Don Smith: Boxing Fans Irate! & Jose Benavidez Homecoming!@#Arizona Boxing News & Notes With Don Smith: Boxing Fans Irate! & Jose Benavidez Homecoming By Don Smith PhilBoxing.com Thu, 07 May 2015 Boxing Fans, Floyd Mayweather remains undefeated after easily defeating his longtime rival, Manny Pacquiao on Saturday, May 2 in Las Vegas, Nevada at the MGM Hotel. Now, fights fans will debate whether the much ballyhooed bout was the Fight of the Century as captioned in several national publications. I talked to fans from both sides of the fan base and I heard no one describe the match as anything more than just another fight and most fans came away disappointed and some of the displeased asked for a refund and the judicial system may listen to their argument. On my scorecard, I ranked the fight, sixth best televised sports event broadcasted on May 2 behind the winning photo finish win of Kentucky Derby winner American Pharaoh, Clippers dramatic win over the Spurs, NFL Draft: rounds 4-7,Rory Mcllroys brilliant performance in Match Cup Play and the always dramatic NHL Playoffs. If I wasnt such an ardent boxing fan, I would drop the boxing contest to 8th behind College Mens Rugby and Womens Softball, also televised on that auspicious day. Hours before the first bell, one fan told me was going to purchase a garbage disposal with the $100.00 requested for the PPV event, but he changed his mind and ordered the fight, a decision he now woefully regrets in hindsight. Check out lawsuit pending segment in lower portion of column. Round one went to Mayweather because he landed a few jabs while Pacquiao was basically a spectator. Pac Man came alive in the second round, but didnt do enough to make his fans confident. I watched the event with a predominant Filipino crowd and the majority held their faces in their hands, disbelieving they were watching a Manny Pacquiao who continued to throw wild punches and look out of sync. Pacquiao need a 10-8 round in the 10th and he needed to win the last two stanzas to avert losing by a unanimous decision. It didnt happen and now his boxing future is uncertain. Mayweather has one more fight on his contract and then its adios to boxing, according to him. Mayweathers handpicked referee (Kenny Bayless) didnt help the smaller Pacquiao by allowing the undefeated Champ to abide by a different set of ring rules. I counted at least three low blows, several wrestling type holds and other boxing infractions that were obvious to anyone who didnt require the aid of a Seeing Eye dog; yet the poor officiating continued throughout the 12 round bout. It just wasnt Manny Pacquiao night. The referee could have been Skip Bayless (writer) or Andy Bayless (Restaurant owner), it didnt matter, Manny Pacquiao was a beaten man when he entered the ring and looked as if he were a lost sailor on a rudderless ship ready to dead end. After the final stanza, I saw it 8 rounds for Mayweather and four for Pacquiao. Give Mayweather his due, but considering the price of admission, fans didnt get much from either hyped warrior in a fight that mocked the sport and fell way short of being the best televised sporting event of the day .refund, please! After and before the event was immortalized, a multitude of complaints were lodged by viewers who deemed the 12 twelve rounder was less satisfying than a quarter pounder from McDonalds. And some last minute would be viewers decided to forgo the telecast after encountering reception problems. More troubling is reports that two working female journalists (Rachel Nichols and Michelle Beadle) werent allowed credentials to cover the fight from inside the venue because they had previously asked questions that focused on Floyd Mayweathers history of domestic violence which led to his incarceration in 2012-2013. A denial was issued by the Mayweather Camp, but the offended reporters werent satisfied with the statement and Beadle actually left town. Both women are established journalists and it is unknown whether or not the reported act of censorship will trigger a backlash from the journalistic community. Boxing News: Valentinos, 43 rd. Avenue & Indian School Road in Phoenix, was penciled as the venue for the next Bout Maker Boxing Promotions event, scheduled for August 29, but Valentinos (Jessica) confirmed the 23,000 square foot sized facility wont be hosting boxing on that night; that honor may be bestowed upon one of the La Princesa facilities in Phoenix. According to BMMP, the Dunlap Avenue located La Princesa is out of the running. Valentinos did host wrestling once upon a time and is available for suitors, parking is free. Interested parties can call Jessica at 602-535-5482 for booking opportunities ..Please include Tom & Joe Garcia in your prayers as they mourn the death of their mother on Monday May 4, six days before Mothers Day. Tom and Joe are two of the best liked guys aligned to Arizona Boxing; our deepest condolences .Alexis Santiago signed a provisional contract to fight WBC Super Bantamweight Champion Leo Santa Cruz on the Mayweather/Pacquiao undercard if designated opponent Jose Cayetano, from Mexico, had visa or weight problems. Cayetano was able to make the gig, so Santiago got paid and was able to watch the fight. No official word on when and where Santiago will fight next The proposed filming of The Celebrity Making of a Champion is being delayed until later in May instead of the highly publicized May 12 date at Knockout Gym and Karlas Bar and Restaurant in Phoenix; organizers plan to notify media when final date is determined. Pending Lawsuit: Plaintiffs, Staphane Vanel and Kami Rahbara, have filed a lawsuit on behalf of fight fans seeking monetary damages against Manny Pacquiao for performing poorly against Floyd Weather as a result of hiding an undisclosed injury that occurred before their May 2 fight. Nevada law requires that a fighter must disclose any injury prior to a bout. Mayweather has agreed to give Pacquiao a rematch after the alleged injury (right shoulder) has healed. Pacquiao claims he reinjured the shoulder in the fourth round. The Filipino fighter admits concealing the injury from Nevada authorities which could earn him a suspension and possible ban. It might be a sad ending to a long and illustrious career. Title Bout & Birthday Celebration: Channel 12 Television (NBC Affiliate in Phoenix) stopped by Central Gym, on Friday May 1, to interview Jose Benavidez Jr. (22-0) who is defending his WBA interim world super lightweight title against Jorge Paez Jr., 38-5-2, (son of legendary Jorge Paez Sr.) on May 15 at US Airways.

The co-main features super lightweights Emmanuel Taylor (18-3) vs. hard hitting Antonio Orozco (21-0). True Television will carry the fight and after the fight, the champion hopes to celebrate birthday # 23 which falls on the day of the fight. If his friends decide early, Jose can blow out the candles as a cardio exercise, but his handlers will surely smack him if his lips touch the cake: Event Tickets is now on sale through Ticket Master and at the US Airways Box-office beginning at $20.00.

!@#I was so disgusted by the trailer that I refused to watch it. The trailer gives me all I need to know about the motives of the producers. Morally, I could not watch the desperate and damaged paraded for my Wednesday night's entertainment. Just like I refuse to watch beheading videos. It would just facilitate the malicious producers to achieve their purpose. The usual suspects on the ABC this morning were hailing the program as 'important' and 'something we need to be aware of'. How cloistered are these people that they are unaware of the massive disadvantage suffered by people in some suburbs? To claim that shit like this is somehow 'educational' is laughable. Sadly this series will probably deliver SBS their highest ratings in years. But these ratings come at the expense of any shred of integrity the hateful little broadcaster has left. This, along with Scott McIntyre's ignorant rant, gives us great insight into the culture at SBS. And we, the taxpayers, are paying for this shit!!@#english

Kids may be learning something, but it isnt U.S. history!@#05.06.15 12:23 PM A new report gauging how well eighth-graders in the U.S. have learned their history and civics lessons reveals extremely low levels of proficiency across a range of student demographics. In the latest iteration of its National Report Card, a project of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a scant 18 percent of American eighth-graders demonstrated a basic proficiency with U.S. history in 2014. They fared little better in other citizenship-related academic subjects like civics and geography. The current version of the NAEP report card considers the performance of more than 29,000 eighth-grade students nationwide on assessment tests covering U.S. history, geography and civics. The NAEP conducts its report card study every four years. While some demographics performed better or worse than in 2014, students’ overall performance, compared with the 2010 report card, was flat: Nationally, eighth graders’ average scores on the NAEP U.S. history, geography, and civics assessments showed no significant change in 2014, compared to 2010 — the last assessment year. However, several student groups have made gains. In 2014, eighteen percent of eighth-graders performed at or above the Proficient level in U.S. history, 27 percent performed at or above the Proficient level in geography, and 23 percent performed at or above the Proficient level in civics. Students performing at or above the Proficient level on NAEP assessments demonstrate solid academic performance and competency over challenging subject matter. Even the best-performing subset of students, as a group, flunk miserably when it comes to knowing their U.S. history. Students of Asian descent did the best, but still managed only 33 percent proficiency in U.S. history. Black students brought up the rear, scoring 6 percent. Unsurprisingly, students who attend private schools fared better than their public-school counterparts. Among private-school students, 31 percent demonstrated proficiency with U.S. history; 44 percent with geography and 38 percent with civics. Among public-school students, 17 percent demonstrated proficiency with U.S. history; 25 percent with geography and 22 percent with civics. Check out the NAEP’s full interactive report card here .

!@#resurrecting this thread because I just saw a john oliver article piece/exposé on standardized testing in America, and how P earson has managed to practically win a stranglehold on the market. according to the evidence he presented every aspect of it is so problem ridden as to be beyond jokeworthy, so much so that teachers, students and parents have been hopping mad for quite some time. Pearson advertising for "scorers wanted" on CL? test questions invoving a rabbit and a pineapple and a race? back to the OP, I didn't realize the magnitude of this problem until today. this has nothing to do with education and performance and everything to do with raking in the $$, often senselessly at the cost of the self esteem of today's student and has no added value whatsoever for the educational system. nick Back to top!@#english
Oldest known Malayan bear in U.S. captivity euthanized in Arizona!@#. View gallery A 34-year-old Malayan sun bear named Dresena is shown in this undated photo released on May 6, 2015. … By David Schwartz PHOENIX (Reuters) - A 34-year-old Malayan sun bear who is believed to be the oldest in U.S. captivity has been euthanized at a southern Arizona zoo, officials said on Wednesday. Dresena, who zoo keepers said had an affinity for peanuts and honey, was put to death on Tuesday after test results late last week confirmed significant abnormalities in her brain. "With a poor long-term prognosis and a continued decline in her condition, it became clear her quality of life would not improve and the very difficult decision to euthanize her was made," Dr. Alexis Moreno, veterinarian at Tucson's Reid Park Zoo, said in a statement. The median life expectancy for female Malayan sun bears is 23 years, according to the zoo. Officials said the 156-pound Dresena came to Tucson from the San Diego Zoo in 2001. They said she had become increasingly shy in the last few years, preferring to stay in her out-of-view den due to her failing eyesight. But she had long been popular with groups attending behind-the-scenes tours and educational programs conducted by the zoo. "She was a special bear, she had a unique way about her," said Vivian VanPeenen, the zoo's education curator. "This is going to leave a void in our zoo family for sure. It's very sad." Sun bears are native to Southeast Asia and considered vulnerable due to deforestation and hunting, zoo officials said. They said the species is also poached for their gall bladders, which are used by some cultures in traditional medicines.

!@#Thanks for the suggestions. I had heard some of this before but was hoping that things may have progressed in the last decade or so. Wouldn't something such as this work? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...8645-_-Product I'm going to see how difficult it would be to design an AM tuner that will at least have headphone jack output if not USB control and output. Many AM tuners have digital interfaces and output can most likely be converted to be carried on a USB bus from what I have read. This will require designing the unit from the ground up, PCB's and all. Should be fun and educational!!@#english
Early lung cancer detection needed!@#Early Lung Cancer Detection Needed May 7, 2015 Home Drugs, Disease & Illness Cancer Tags: Cancer When Dana Reeve, widow of actor Christopher Reeve, died of lung cancer, the stories of her death pointed out that she didn't smoke. She was young, only 44; she had nursed her paralyzed husband for eight years; she left a 13-year-old son an orphan. And how could she have gotten lung cancer? She had never smoked.Lung cancer is often preventable, and it is usually fatal. Unfortunately I will also become a victim of this disease. Not for myself, but a victim because I am a friend of a lung cancer person. One of my very dearest friends will undergo a lung operation this coming Tuesday. Be cautious of any information or claims obtained from unmonitored sources, in particular the Internet. The Internet can be an empowering source of information, but a healthcare professional should be consulted before making medical decisions. What is cancer? Cancer is a disease that starts in our cells. Our bodies are made up of millions of cells, grouped together to form tissues or organs. Genes inside each cell order it to grow, work, reproduce and die. Normally, our cells remain healthy. Sometimes a cell's instructions get mixed up and it behaves abnormally. After a while, groups of abnormal cells can circulate in the blood or immune system, or they can form lumps or tumours. Tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign tumour cells stay in one place in the body and are not usually life-threatening. Malignant tumour cells are able to invade the tissues around them and spread to other parts of the body. Cancerous cells that spread to other parts of the body are called metastases. The first sign that a malignant tumour has spread is often swelling of nearby lymph nodes, but cancer can metastasize to almost any part of the body. It is important to find malignant tumours early and treat them. Cancers are named after the part of the body where they start. For example, cancer that starts in the colon but spreads to the liver is called colon cancer with liver metastases. There are four main types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Tobacco smoking is strongly linked to the first three but only weakly linked to adenocarcinoma. However, this type of lung cancer has been linked to the use of low-tar cigarettes. The best means of prevention is to never start smoking or using chewing tobacco, or to stop using tobacco products. A healthy diet is an important part of prevention. The outlook varies by cell type and stage of the disease. In general, the prognosis is better for squamous cell cancers than for adenocarcinomas. Early detection is key to better chances of survival. According to the American Lung Association, 87 percent of lung cancer cases are caused by smoking. Another 12 percent are linked to radon exposure. Only 15 percent of people diagnosed with the disease will still be alive five years after the diagnosis; 60 percent die within the first year. What is Chemoprevention? For individuals who demonstrate the greatest risk, researchers are currently conducting several new trials to test the use of natural and synthetic substances to prevent development of the disease. This new research has been coined, chemoprevention. The National Cancer Institute's (NCI) chemoprevention research effort started in the early 1980s and has grown considerably since that time. Currently, approximately 400 compounds are being studied as potential chemopreventive agents, mainly in laboratory research. Over 40 of these compounds are being studied in clinical trials (research studies with people). Some of these agents are being investigated as single agents; others are being tested in combinations of two drugs. Chemoprevention trials look at possible ways to prevent cancer with interventions that include drugs, vitamins, diet, hormone therapy, or other agents. The American Cancer Society (ACS) has set aggressive challenge goals for the nation to decrease cancer incidence and mortality--and to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors--by the year 2015. To address these critical goals, the ACS publishes the Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidelines to serve as a foundation for its communication, policy, and community strategies and ultimately, to affect dietary and physical activity patterns among Americans. These guidelines, published every five years, are developed by a national panel of experts in cancer research, prevention, epidemiology, public health, and policy, and as such, they represent the most current scientific evidence related to dietary and activity patterns and cancer risk. The ACS guidelines are consistent with guidelines from the American Heart Association for the prevention of coronary heart disease as well as for general health promotion, as defined by the Department of Health and Human Services' 2000 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In 2006 there will be an estimated 174,470 new cases of lung cancer and an estimated 162,460 Americans will die from the disease. The American Cancer Society offers support and hope for people diagnosed with lung cancer and their families as well as resources to help smokers quit 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including its own Quitline, which since its launch in May 2000 has provided services to more than 150,000 callers. For more information, call 800-ACS-2345 or visit www.cancer.org. Lung cancer chemoprevention - Why does it not work?From the National Cancer Center. Common wisdom is that vitamin in fruits and vegetables prevent cancer. However, trials of supplementing vitamins like vitamin A analogues (retinoids: beta-carotene, retinol, retinyl palmitate, or isotretinoin) or vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), did not prevent lung cancer in smokers. Randomised trials in all the three settings: primary (healthy high-risk e.g. smokers), secondary (pre-malignant lesions), and tertiary (prevention of second primary tumours in previously treated patients), have produced negative results (either neutral or harmful). Chemoprevention trials were prompted by relationship between diet and lung cancer. Diet rich in foliage vitamins was protective against lung cancer - as demonstrated in a recent Dutch study of 939 patients. Similarly, higher blood level of ß-carotene is linked to a lower risk of lung cancer. Nonetheless, intervention trials failed to show a reduced risk in lung cancer by consuming ß-carotene. A phase III trial, the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) [beta-carotene (20 mg/d), alpha-tocopherol (50mg/d)] indicated significant increases in lung cancer incidence (18%) and no effect on lung cancer mortality (risk ratio, 0.99). Another study, CARET, had a 28% increase in lung cancer with vitamin treatment. Similarly, in both Euro-scan and the US-Lung Intergroup Trial (both testing retinoids in tertiary prevention), results were neutral. Disclaimer: please.

!@#I just had to shake out one of my hives due to the same issue is listed by the OP. I tried to give them a frame of eggs/larvae thing but they just capped them. That frame was the only one I could afford to give up. I now wish I would have saved that frame and tried a different strategy. A week after the frame donation I shook the bees out a couple of hundred feet away from the hive location. They tried to enter a dead out next to their hive. I removed the dead out and they congregated on their hive stand. With a few sweeps of the bee brush to get them flying they moved into the other two hives in the yard. There was still a cluster of nurse/laying workerbees on the ground in the shake out area that died overnight. The frame with capped brood was donated to my weakest colony for them to finish up. Looking back on this experience, I would have saved that frame of brood and just shaken the hive out, treating it like a dead out and allowing the foragers to strengthen the other hives in the yard. However, if it was a bit later in the year, my other colonies stronger and there were drones around I would have tried something different wioth with what I now know. That is, I could have removed the laying worker hive and set up a nucleus box with one or two frame of eggs/larvae/brood in that location. I suspect the shaken out foragers would have entered this nuc and had the resources to start a queen on theri own. I dreaded doing the shake out, but it was a very educational experience. I should have been less hesitant to do it and let those resources go where they would do the most good. I think those frames from the "one frame a week" strategy could be better used to create a spliit, although if I am ever in this situation again and have the resources to do so, I will probably give that one frame a week strategy a try just to see how it works. Of course, my main goal at this point is to learn. Making honey is down much further on the priority list than learning.!@#english
Out-of-control 5-year-old handcuffed, shackled by New York State police!@#http://rt.com/usa/255465-handcuff-sh...child-newyork/ Quote: : A five-year-old enrolled in a special needs curriculum was allegedly so unruly that New York state police decided to handcuff him, shackle his feet, and transport him to a hospital for a medical health evaluation before his parents could arrive. Connor Ruiz was screaming, kicking, punching and biting when two New York state troopers arrived at Philadelphia Primary School in northern New York, a spokesman for the state police told the Watertown Daily Times. Though the staff had training for "nonviolent crisis intervention," according to Jefferson-Lewis Board of Cooperative Educational Services superintendent Stephen J. Todd, it could not "deescalate the situation" before police were called. According to a police report -- parts of which were disclosed by state police -- young Ruiz was jumping from cabinets and desks, was attempting to jump out of a window ... he was stabbing himself with pencils and eating paper. Two troopers allegedly attempted to restrain Ruiz, first with non-physical tactics, before deciding to handcuff him. He was eventually shackled at his feet because he was attempting to kick and be physically combative, said state police spokesman Trooper Jack Keller. Our concern was his safety, of not only himself but the staff he was dealing with and the other students in the class where he was, Keller added. Yet the boys mother, Chelsea Ruiz, said she was not notified of her sons disruptive behavior before police were called. She said she or the boys father could have settled the situation. Connor was only enrolled in the special-needs classroom about two weeks ago after being diagnosed recently with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder, she said. He is now emotionally traumatized, she added. An officer told me they had to handcuff his wrists and ankles for their safety, she told the Watertown Daily Times. I told him that was ridiculous. How could someone fear for their safety when it comes to a small, 5-year-old child? He said that he understood because he had four children of his own. She said her son was not put into a booster seat in the police car on the way to Samaritan Medical Center. If an accident happened, my son had no way of protecting himself because his hands and feet were bound, she said. Keller said: Car seats arent required in emergency vehicles because they are exempt from seat belt laws, and that the troopers main concern was to get him into the hospital as quickly as we could. Then, at the hospital, professionals decided her son did not require a psychiatric evaluation. The doctor who decides whether a person needs to see the psychiatrist decided he was just being a boy and threw a tantrum, Chelsea Ruiz said. She said she plans to file a lawsuit against the school for emotional distress, child cruelty, and endangerment for cuffing his hands and feet. They made an extremely bold move, because I could have come to the school and all of his actions would have ceased, she said. We had a plan in place so they would call me to come to the school if they couldnt calm him down, and they didnt do that. Superintendent Todd said: Our records show the father OKd the transport, yet the boys father, Ryan Ruiz, said otherwise. They called me at work and told me Connor was acting up and trying to eat crayons and that he was being taken to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, Ruiz told the Daily Times. I would have told them not to do it, but they didnt ask me. One of us could have came to try to calm him down, but I was never asked. It would have taken me about 20 minutes to get there. Whenever happened to "Here's a lollipop if you sit down and quiet down for a minute?" where the said lollipop has tranquillizer? No, he's been treated like a hard core convict with lengthy history of escaping jails. Only 5 year old??!@#english
!@#Some eggs hatched today so the clock is on until I can see what they do (drones or workers). It has been educational watching them behind glass for hours and seeing this odd behavior. I have read about it, but seeing it in action adds a whole new perspective. The worker that was laying was surrounded like the queen but some bees reacted violently to her once she laid the egg in the drone cell. Its like a battle of allegiance playing out.!@#english
Canon U.S.A. and Little League Partner on The Picture Perfect Season!@#From Canon USA: Three Lucky Fans Will Win a Trip To The Little League World Series in August MELVILLE, N.Y., MAY 6, 2015 - Canon U.S.A., Inc., a leader in digital imaging solutions, today announced the continuation of their multi-year partnership as the official camera and printer sponsor of Little League Baseball and Softball, the world's largest youth sports organization. As part of the partnership, Canon and Little League are teaming up to present the "Picture Perfect Season," a initiative kicking off this month with the Canon Little League Photo Contest powered by PIXMA Printers. By submitting their photos based on three monthly themes, fans will have the chance to win one of three trips to the Little League Baseball World Series in South Williamsport, PA and see their photos on display in the World of Little League Museum in the Richard "Hank" Bauer, Jr. Little League Photography Exhibit in the World Series Gallery presented by Easton Foundations. "Canon is thrilled to support the Little League World Series, capturing special moments of fans, families and players," said Yuichi Ishizuka, president and COO, Canon U.S.A., Inc. "This year, through the use of our input-to-output solutions, we're taking the Great Wall of Fandom on the road and inviting fans at the regional tournaments to show their support on the ground through Regional Walls of Fandom. Culminating at Williamsport and displayed during the tournament, we're excited to share the power of the printed image with fans across the country and deepen our relationship with Little League." The Canon Little League Photo Contest powered by PIXMA Printers kicks off with "Stepping Up to the Plate," a theme focusing on shots of game play. Whether it's a Little Leaguer sliding into home base or catching a fly ball, these images should capture the essence of what it means to be on the field. Entries will be judged on the use of theme and on the quality of the image and overall impression. The contest is open to U.S. and Canadian residents aged 18 and up. To submit your photos and read the official rules, visit littleleague.org/canonphotocontest . Last year, Canon built "The Great Wall of Fandom," a real-time installation showcasing photos and messages from fans around the world, in support of the teams at the Little League Baseball World Series. This year, Canon and the Little League community will be using the Canon PIXMA MG7520 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-In-One printer to bring the photos to life throughout the entire journey, capturing and preserving moments from Opening Day to the Regional Tournaments, both nationally and internationally, and culminating at the Little League Baseball World Series. Canon will also be hosting the PIXMA Play and Print Experience loaded with baseball-themed activities for kids, giving fans in Williamsport another way to make their fandom real during every moment of the action. Beginning in late July and running through the end of the tournament on August 30th, baseball fans around the world can share photos and words of encouragement via thegreatwalloffandom.com . Fans at regional tournaments will also be encouraged to print and show their support on their region's very own Great Wall of Fandom. In both instances, Canon will print high-quality versions of the photos and messages on a Canon PIXMA MG7520 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-In-One printer, made possible via cloud connectivity, and add them to "The Great Wall of Fandom." This year marks the 76th Anniversary of Little League, and part of its longtime success in providing healthy youth sports opportunities for 2.4 million children in more than 80 countries can be attributed to the assistance provided by sponsorships. Canon continues its partnership with Little League as one of 16 national sponsors, which helps Little League maintain low-team affiliation fees and provide valuable training and educational resources to coaches, parents, umpires, and volunteers. Many of Little League's national sponsors also participate in enhancing the fan experience at the Little League Baseball World Series Family Fun Zone. "We are excited to continue our partnership with Canon as a national sponsor of Little League and the Little League Baseball World Series," said Liz DiLullo Brown, Little League vice president of Marketing and Strategic Partnerships. "Little League is more than a youth sports organization, it is a youth leadership organization, and thanks to the support of our national sponsors, Little League is able to provide parents a healthy, affordable recreational outlet for their children. Canon's involvement with Little League reminds us to capture and preserve the precious moments that children make on Little League fields around the world."  !@#english
Atlanta to Host Media leaders from China and the United States!@#ATLANTA, May 6, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The following is being released by The Aspen Institute: View photo . Media executives and journalists from China and the United States will meet for a daylong roundtable session in Atlanta on Thursday, May 7, 2015. About a dozen representatives of each country's media will discuss areas of potential collaborations and exchanges. Attendees Among those attending are Madam Cui Yuying , vice minister of the Chinese State Council Information Office (SCIO) and Zhang Fuhai , director-general of the International Affairs Bureau of the SCIO. On the American side, participants include Teya Ryan , CEO of GPB Media (Georgia Public Broadcasting), Juan Williams , commentator on Fox News, and Mike Finnerty , senior vice president of the Weather Company, owner of the Weather Channel. Among those attending from the Atlanta area are Fredricka Whitfield , anchor, CNN; Mike Dreaden , news editor, WSB-TV; Mark Waligore , managing editor, Atlanta Journal Constitution; and James Black , assistant director of the Center for Collaborative Journalism, Mercer University. Meeting Agenda On the morning of May 7 participants will hear from Vice Minister Cui, Aspen Institute Vice President Charles Firestone, and Vice President of Dolby Laboratories Jeffrey Moon. They will also view a re-edited version of the documentary, Touching the Tigers, a collaboration of Chinese and American documentarian film makers, chronicling the work of the Flying Tigers in World War II. Malcolm Clarke, director of the film, will also address the group. In the afternoon, the participants will go into private session to address how to foster exchanges of journalists between the two countries, and whether there are opportunities for other collaborations.

Thai politics: Article 44 cannot be a shortcut to solve urgent problems!@#BURNING ISSUE Article 44 cannot be a shortcut to solve urgent problems Attayuth Bootsripoom BANGKOK: -- During a period of a little over a month, General Prayut Chan-o-cha, as leader of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), has issued 10 orders under the power given to him by the post-coup provisional charter. The orders can be divided into six groups and most are aimed at solving the country's long-standing problems, such as encroachment of national forests and public land, illegal fishing and lottery-ticket overpricing. Prime Minister Prayut invoked Article 44 of the interim constitution in issuing the orders. The first group of orders involves lifting of martial law, which had been in force since before the coup in May last year. The NCPO Order No 3/2558, which is about national security, appoints military officers as "peace and order maintaining officers". Later, the NCPO chief issued Order No 5/2558 to revise that previous order, also appointing Army rangers as assistants to the peace and order maintaining officers. The second group is about the fight against encroachment on national forests and public land. The NCPO's Order No 4/2558 empowered government ministers to seek help from military officers in protecting forests and public space from encroachment. The third group of orders involved removal of senior public officials from office and appointment of their replacements. The NCPO's Order No 6/2558 removed the permanent secretary of the Education Ministry and some other senior officials there. Order No 7/2558 removed all board members of the Teachers Council of Thailand, the Welfare Promotion Commission for Teachers and Educational Personnel, and the commission's Business Organisation. The problem of corruption was cited for the abrupt changes at those three agencies. Order No 9/2558 sacked a senior Department of Employment official in Chon Buri, as part of an effort to solve the problem of illegal migrants and human trafficking. The fourth group of orders was issued to get rid of some legal obstacles. The NCPO's Order No 8/2558 stated that the remaining members of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) should be regarded as fully functional after one left and the National Legislative Assembly refused to select any of the four nominees suggested by a government selection committee. The fifth group involved efforts to solve the problem of illegal fishing. The NCPO's Order No 10/2558 was aimed at solving the problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, an issue that led to a threat by the European Union to ban Thai seafo od products. A command centre to deal with the problem has been set up and will report directly to the prime minister. It is headed by the Navy commander-in-chief. The last group of recent NCPO orders was aimed at tackling the problem of overpriced lottery tickets. The NCPO's Order No 11/2558 removed all board members of the Government Lottery Office (GLO) after they failed to solve the problem. The order also imposed penalties on those selling lottery tickets higher than the stated price of Bt80 each. The violators risk a maximum imprisonment of one month, a fine of no more than Bt10,000, or both. Another NCPO order appoints Maj-General Apirach Kongsompong, deputy commander of the First Army Region, as the new chairman of the GLO's executive board. Three more board members were also appointed. It seems the NCPO has tried to solve the country's problems with the special power under Article 44. The government is well aware that those complex problems cannot be solved through ordinary means. Also, they want their efforts over these problems to be the NCPO's selling point to win public support. This may be "constructive use" of Article 44, as stated earlier by General Prayut. But the question is, can we still solve the country's problems through normal means and processes? And if Article 44 also fails to help solve the problems, do we have any other measure to use?

Eureka! Pictures capture moment wild gorilla works out how to use tools - the first time behaviour has ever been seen in the primates!@#2 View comments For the first time, a gorilla in the wild has been seen using tools - using a stick to capture and then eat ants. Previously the behaviour had only been seen in chimpanzees. Researchers were observing one of eight mountain gorilla groups habituated to humans in the Volcanoes National Park, in Rwanda. Lisanga, a juvenile female, using a stick to catch and then eat ants - the first time the behaviour has been seen in the wild. APES WITH TOOLS Tool use is well-documented among wild chimpanzees. Captive orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos have all been observed using tools in a variety of contexts for food extraction. However, this is the first time the behaviour has been seen in gorillas. The use of the stick was witnessed by Dr Jean-Felix Kinani, the head veterinarian with Gorilla Doctors , an organisation of vets that works with wildlife authorities to monitor the health of wild gorillas in the area. 'This is the first time tool use has been reported in a wild mountain gorilla despite the intensive monitoring of this subspecies,' the team say. 'A routine health check, including behavioral observations, was performed by one veterinarian and two trackers on May 14, 2013 (the end of the main rainy season) in the Neoboutonia Forest at 7389 feet (2252 m.) altitude, the researchers wrote. 'During the 2 hr monitoring visit, Kigoma, the second ranking silverback, was observed to use his left hand to collect driver ants (Dorylus sp.) from a hole in the ground. 'When he first inserted his hand into the hole, he quickly withdrew it and ran from the hole while shaking his left arm, presumably to remove the biting ants.'

UAE to probe Mars' atmosphere with spacecraft named 'Hope' Share this article Share However, one of the females in the group, called Lisanga, witnessed the event - and it gave her an idea. 'Lisanga, a juvenile female, was approximately 6m away from Kigoma at this time and observed him eating the ants and running away. 'She then approached the hole and watched the ants entering and exiting the hole for approximately 2 min. Lisanga approached the hole and watched the ants entering and exiting the hole for approximately 2 min. She then put her left hand into the hole, but quickly withdrew her hand covered in ants, shaking her arm vigorously, again presumably due to painful ant bites. 'She proceeded to insert her left hand into the hole, but quickly withdrew her hand covered in ants, shaking her arm vigorously, again presumably due to painful ant bites.' She was then observed to select a piece of wood off the ground that was approximately 20 cm long and 2 cm wide at one end, 1 cm wide at the other. The piece of wood was a freshly broken branch, thought to be from a tree found 2 m from the ant hole. She inserted the stick into the hole and then withdrew the stick, licking the ants off of the stick. 'After licking the ants off the stick, Lisanga ran away shaking her left hand to remove the still biting ants.' The team say no other gorillas appeared to have witnessed Lisanga using the stick nor were any other gorillas observed trying to eat ants during this observation period.' She then finds a stick, inserts the stick into the hole and then withdrew the stick, licking the ants off of the stick. Lisanga is a curious gorilla,' explained Dr Kinani to the BBC . 'She is known to have an investigative personality.' For example, one anecdotal report details her showing more than casual interest in a researcher's bag, quietly approaching behind the researcher and attempting to take the bag away. HOW MANY MOUNTAIN GORILLAS ARE THERE? The number of mountain gorillas living in the Virunga volcanic mountain range on the borders of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo plummeted to approximately 253 in 1981 as a result of habitat destruction and hunting. Since then, conservation efforts led by the Rwanda Development Board and conservation organizations like the Gorilla Doctors (a partnership between the non-profit Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project and the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center), and supported by tourists keen to see the gorillas made famous by late primatologist Dian Fossey, have bolstered numbers to approximately 480 among the Virunga population.

By: Saumitra Chaudhuri The past decade has seen an absolute decline i!@#By: Saumitra Chaudhuri The past decade has seen an absolute decline in the number of people engaged in agriculture. Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, the workforce in agriculture declined by as much as 33 million. And the number of non-farm workforce increased by 48 million. This reflects changing educational levels, skill sets and, most importantly, the aspiration of young rural Indians. Not all who left the farm went to towns, as new kinds of non-farm income opportunities emerged in rural India — from selling mobile top-ups to servicing farm equipment. There was a large retention of young people aged between 14 and 19 in education and, to that extent, the labour force expansion was temporarily restricted in this period, which would be reversed subsequently. However, the evidence is that the income opportunities in the form of jobs or self-employment do not seem to have kept pace with the pace at which young people with some education have joined, and prospectively will be joining, the workforce. There are several consequences of this. First, with depleting numbers, agricultural wages are bound to increase — as, indeed, they have over the last several years. Second, the change in the workforce and supply factors have induced a large degree of mechanisation of farm activities across the country, which has raised the productivity of labour working the farm and the rise in wages, to that extent, reflects higher productivity. There is a belief that the increase in prices of farm produce over the past six years was an outcome of increased rural wages. This narrative can be found in the analysis of the financial sector, in the media and, surprisingly, in some official texts. What makes you think they are all farmers? The primary reason for the rise in food prices was a combination of higher world prices that touched record levels in 2011 and 2012, and the dysfunctional nature of the marketing institutions for fresh farm produce —fruit and vegetables — which lend itself to price gouging from which farmers do not benefit and the consumer suffers. Rural wage increases played a secondary role. Money Plant Grows The farm sector gained ground in the past decade. Agricultural growth rates averaged 3.6% in this decade, a significant improvement over the 2.5% in the previous decade. Most of the increase in farm incomes came from horticulture, animal husbandry and cash crops such as cotton. Remunerative procurement prices and high global commodity prices helped and the need for official price support and intervention still remain. Much remains to be done in reforming fertiliser pricing and usage, and in provision of water security. Rural India also gained from the massive expansion in rural infrastructure: roads, irrigation, telephony, healthcare and education. It connected the small grower to the expanding urban market and the village resident to urban work opportunity, in an unprecedented manner. This was true for every state, with some states achieving better outcomes. The weather is a great challenge. We had the worst monsoon in 28 years in 2009 and rainfall in both 2012 and 2014 was weak. The forecast for 2015 suggests a repetition. Unfortunately, we have yet to make the best of what rains we get in this country. To take an example, Vidarbha gets nearly 1,000 mm of rainfall in the southwest monsoon, much more than the 500 mm in Punjab or 260 mm in west Rajasthan. Yet, the terrible news about farmer suicides come mostly from Vidarbha. Storing the rain that falls and runs off from the fields in overground reservoirs, or by charging underground aquifers and combining it with micro-irrigation, would transform the region. An effort was made to start this process in 2010 and Vidarbha was the first region to have satellite-based aquifer-imaging done and provisions for micro-irrigation were started. But the change is yet to make its effect felt on the ground. India is fortunate in the precipitation (nearly 1,000 mm) it gets from the southwest and other monsoonal rains. The rainfall has to be used to fill reservoirs and charge our extensive aquifer system. In the use of the water, we have to radically improve our efficiency — which can realistically be done through micro-irrigation. Rain, Rain, Come Again A second weak monsoon will stress the economy further. Output declines may fuel increase in food prices and lower rural incomes may further exacerbate a level of rural demand that has already been weakened last year. In the medium term, the imperative to create jobs and employment opportunities in the tens of millions has to be the primary aim of economic policy. Focused attention on developing manufacturing zones and building up infrastructure will undoubtedly help the process. However, it is the across-the-board revival of economic growth that is the only means available to ensure that livelihood opportunities become available in adequate numbers. Such openings are taking place but at an insufficient pace. The escalation of this pace depends on the acceleration of the economy. The writer was member, Planning Commission!@#english

!@#Middle School Art Teacher chiming in: You'd be surprised at how much a person can improve with the right guidance. Much of what you know regarding creating is "self learned" or a collection of visual biases. If you ask people at random to draw an apple in front of them, they will draw the notion or idea of what they think an apple looks like - rarely will they take the time to draw the specific apple set before them. Drawing is easy to do, but hard to do right. We often require variety of instruction to meet personal educational needs, and it is in that variation that we discover what works for each of us. When you start to recognize how and why things look better, then you can self check resulting in improvement. In short: If it's taught to you in a way you understand, you'll improve considerably. There is no question that the OC is talented, this is exemplified by the exponential growth in production. My assumption is that the artist is independent and self motivated to become a better artist. A lot of my students complain about their poor abilities, but show no interest in developing their skills. I'm curious to see what will be made of that ability.!@#english
!@#Sorry Tivka, but I seriously disagree with your stance on this show. Especially as you didn't watch it. I ran a community centre in a very similar area for quite a few years. I worked with people just like this. I didn't live it - I went back to my comfortable, safe, middle class home every night, and thanked my luck that I was able to do that. This was not "reality TV", it was a documentary. It was educational. There are a lot of middle class, fortunate people, who never see into these lives, never see into the homes and the history and the perpetual cycle of poverty that many of these families struggle with. I think it is an important message. I also think that anyone who voted for the current Government and supported the cuts they have proposed and made needs to see more of this. Not the "dole bludgers" on Today Tonight, but the babies being born to children themselves, the child of the ice addict who's family are desperate to help him. That is the story. As a PP said, if we cannot watch that and feel compassion, or find a way to laugh, it is a sad indictment on our society. SBS may have removed a few parts of the show, but they would not have been able to edit together a show as it was if they only had Big-Brother type footage. I'm not going to donate half my income. But I think you should watch before you berate those of us who did. Overall it saddened me that the situation in our community has not changed one iota since I was working there 15 years ago. In fact, due to budget/funding cuts, and ICE, it's probably a lot worse. IF this show educates people in compassion and the reality of the situation for those they don't know and will never meet, then it is a good thing.!@#english
!@#Quote: : Shifting blame to others never solves individual failings. It's why all welfare states inevitably collapse under their own weight. The minute you make shifting blame an acceptable way to avoid self-responsibility, you start a snowball down a hill. It can do nothing else but grow and grow until it impacts with something destructively. History has a perfect record of consistency on this point. Every welfare state ever collapsed. It's never "if", it's always "when." You hit on one of the top problems in America and maybe the top problem. People not accepting personal responsibility. You can look as high as the president who plays the blame game to the lowest in our society who blame others for their situations. Politicians on both sides of the aisle do it. Liberals will never accept personal responsibility as the poors way out of poverty. I believe the liberals have a lot of guilt in the situation many poor are in. Of course vote buying is another reason liberals just throw money at the problems of the poor. Liberals are trying to legislate living wages to minimum skill and minimum effort workers. Moving the bottom rung of the wage scale higher will eventually move all the other rungs up as well. Leaving the poor, still poor and still at the bottom rung. Investing more federal money in facilities and programs to help the poor will do nothing but throw money at the problem and the next riot we will watch the investments made burn to the ground. The way to move from the bottom rung of the ladder, both in life and income, is by being: Personally responsible for yourself: - Personally responsible for your education. - Personally responsible for the children you bring into the world. - Personally responsible for your performance at your job. - Personally responsible for earning enough to support your own family - Personally responsible for helping others by your own efforts or income. What liberals don't understand is that you can't legislate away being poor. You can't legislate away the poverty of folks who are too lazy or unmotivated to help themselves. Liberal entitlement programs do nothing to get people out of poverty. In fact they help keep them there. Government entitlement programs need to reward those that are down on their luck, but are trying to pick themselves up. Not reward them for doing nothing. Anyone getting government assistance should have educational or work requirements attached to the benefit. And yes the government needs to inspect the programs and requirements so we get what we expect.!@#english

Practical Thoughts on Immigration!@#Imprimus A Publiction of Hillsdale College February 2015 | Volume 44, Number 2 Heather Mac Donald Manhattan Institute The following is adapted from a speech delivered on February 18, 2015, at a Hillsdale College National Leadership Seminar in Naples, Florida. The lesson from the last 20 years of immigration policy is that lawlessness breeds more lawlessness. Once a people or a government decides to normalize one form of lawbreaking, other forms of lawlessness will follow until finally the rule of law itself is in profound jeopardy. Today, we have a constitutional crisis on our hands. President Obama has decided that because Congress has not granted amnesty to millions of illegal aliens living in the U.S., he will do so himself. Let us ponder for a moment just how shameless this assertion of power is. Article 2, Section 3, of the Constitution mandates that the president shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. This provision assumes that there is a law for the president to execute. But in this case, the problem that Obama is purporting to fix is the absence of a law granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens. Rather than executing a law, Obama is making one uparrogating to himself a function that the Constitution explicitly allocates to Congress. Should this unconstitutional power grab stand, we will have moved very far in the direction of rule by dictator. Pace Obama, the absence of a congressional law granting amnesty is not evidence of political failure that must somehow be corrected by unilateral executive action; it is evidence of the lack of popular consensus regarding amnesty. There has been no amnesty statute to date because the political will for such an amnesty is lacking. On February 16, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen halted President Obamas illegal amnesty with a temporary injunction. The proposed amnesty program, Judge Hanen found, went far beyond mere prosecutorial discretion not to enforce the law against individuals. Instead, the Department of Homeland Security proposed to confer on illegal aliens a new legal status known as legal presence. But Congress has not granted DHS the power to create and bestow legal status. The amnesty program represented a complete abdication of DHSs responsibility to enforce the law, Judge Hanen declared. Indeed, DHS was actively thwarting the express will of Congress. Pursuant to traditional canons of judicial interpretation, Judge Hanen ruled against the Obama administration on the narrowest possible grounds in order to avoid reaching the constitutional question. He based his decision on the law governing agency rulemaking, rather than on separation of powers grounds. But his rebuke was just as scathing. The administration will likely fight the ruling through the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and, if necessary, all the way to the Supreme Court. Democrats should hope that the administration loses. They are assiduously pretending that Obamas executive amnesty is merely an innocuous exercise of prosecutorial discretion. But if Obamas power grab is upheld, they will rue the day that they acceded to this travesty when a Republican president decides, say, to privatize Social Security because Congress has failed to do so. Obamas executive amnesty is the most public and egregious example of immigration lawlessness to date. But beneath the radar screen has been an equally telling saga of cascading lawlessness that is arguably as consequential: an ongoing attack on the Secure Communities program and on deportation more generally. Because of this attack, the rallying cry of so many conservatives that we must secure the borders is a naïve and meaningless delusion. *** The Secure Communities program is a commonsensical response to illegal alien criminality. Whenever an illegal alien is booked into a local jail on suspicion of a crime, an alert is automatically sent to federal authorities in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. ICE agents can then ask that the jail or prison briefly hold the illegal alien after he has served his time rather than releasing him, so that ICE can pick him up and start deportation proceedings. This is known as a detainer. You would think that such a program would be wholly uncontroversial. An alien who crosses into our country illegally already has no claim to undisturbed presence here. He has voluntarily assumed the risk of deportation. But an illegal alien who goes on to break other laws has even less claim to protection from deportation. Yet Secure Communities has been the target of incessant protest from illegal alien advocates since its inception. Those advocates make the astonishing claim that it is unfair to remove an illegal alien who commits other crimes. Even more astonishing, nearly 300 jurisdictions agree, including New York State, California, New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. They have openly refused to honor ICEs requests for detainers, but instead have released tens of thousands of criminals back on to the streets where they easily evade detection. Not that ICE would be likely to try to pick them up! Indeed, the irony regarding the agitation against Secure Communities is that ICE rarely uses its power under the program. In 2012the last year for which we have complete figuresthe agency was notified of over 400,000 illegal jail detainees, but removed only 19 percent of them. And about 50 percent of the criminal illegal aliens whom ICE chooses not to deport reoffend upon release. *** There are two aspects of the campaign against Secure Communities that bear particular notice: the hypocrisy of the Obama administration and the campaigns advocates, and the hypocrisy of big city police chiefs. In 2012, Arizona became the target of universal contempt among the countrys elites for passing a law that encouraged local law enforcement officers to assist ICE with immigration enforcement. According to illegal alien advocates and the Obama administration, this law, known as SB 1070, was an unconstitutional state usurpation of the federal governments plenary power over immigration matters. The Obama administration sued Arizona for allegedly interfering with federal authority over immigration and won an injunction against SB 1070. Yet now these same advocates are urging states and localities to defy the federal governments requests for immigration assistance, resulting in the creation of local sanctuary zones where federal immigration authority cannot reach. If ever there were a lawless usurpation of the federal governments power over immigration, the open revolt against Secure Communities is it. Yet the Obama administration, rather than hauling these recalcitrant jurisdictions to court, has lain supine and chastely looked the other way. And late last year, it threw in the towel completely. It dismantled the Secure Communities program except in a few narrow instances, agreeing with the activists that it was unfair to worry illegal alien criminals about deportation. There is another aspect of the campaign against Secure Communities that shows the corrosiveness of our tolerance of lawlessness. Major police chiefs in high immigration jurisdictions are under enormous political pressure to protect illegal aliens. And that has meant tossing aside everything that they know about public safety and policing. One of the great insights of policing in the last two decades was the realization that low level misdemeanor offenses like graffiti, turnstile jumping, drunk driving, and drug sales have an outsized impact on a communitys perceptions of public safety and on the actual reality of crime. Enforcing misdemeanor offenses is an effective way of incapacitating more serious criminals. And even when an offender does not go on to commit more violent felonies, such allegedly minor offenses as shoplifting and illegal street vending create a sense of lawlessness and disorder that breaks down the fabric of a community. Police chiefs like New Yorks William Bratton and Los Angeless Charlie Beck know this. Yet they have fiercely opposed cooperating with the federal government on Secure Communities, on the ground that misdemeanor offenses are too trivial to worry about and should not subject illegal aliens to deportation. This is pure hypocrisythe result of the enormous pressure of demographic change on our principles. The ultimate goal of the campaign against Secure Communities is to delegitimate deportation entirely as a response to illegal immigration. If it is morally unacceptable to repatriate even a convicted illegal alien criminal, then it is all the more unacceptable to repatriate someone who has merely crossed the border illegally. This undermining of alien-removals is behind the constant protests demanding to stop deportations now. It is behind the claim that it is Americans who are to blame for separating families, rather than the alien who knowingly came into the country in violation of our laws and assumed the risk of being sent home. The campaign against deportation does not name itself as such, but it has been highly successful. Despite the false rhetoric of the Obama administration, deportation has basically disappeared from the interior of the country. The removal rate in 2014 for illegal aliens who were not explicit ICE priorities was one-half of one percent. If aliens cannot be removed for illegal entry, then there is no more immigration law. Deportation is the only remedy for illegal entry that corrects and deters the original lawbreaking. That is why Mexico, along with virtually every other country, practices it unapologetically. Lose deportation, as we are doing, and the U.S. will have formally ceded control of its immigration policy to people living outside its borders. National sovereignty will have become meaningless. The delegitimizing of deportation makes the conservative rallying cry to secure the borders sadly naïve. An utterly secure border is impossible; people will always find a way to cross. But if, once they cross, nothing can be done to them, then we may as well not have borders. Thats why the advocates have spent all their energy fighting deportation rather than fighting increased border securitybecause they know that eradicating the former is far more important. *** The erosion of the rule of law is bad enough. But the social consequences of mass illegal immigration are equally troubling. We are importing poverty and educational failure. If you want to see Americas future, look no further than my home state of California, which is a generation ahead of the rest of the country in experiencing the effects of unchecked low-skilled immigration. Nearly 50 percent of all California births are now Hispanic, and the states Hispanic population is now almost equal to the white population. The consequences of this demographic shift have been profound. In the 1950s and 60s, California led in educational achievement. Today, with a majority Hispanic K-12 population and the largest concentration of English language learners in the country, California is at the bottom of the educational heap. Over a third of California eighth graders lack even the most rudimentary math skills; 28 percent are equally deficient in reading. The mathematics performance gap between Hispanic and white eighth-graders has not budged since 1990; the reading gap has narrowed only slightly since 1998. California is at the epicenter of the disturbing phenomenon of long-term English learners. You would think that an English learner would be someone who grew up in a foreign country speaking a foreign language, and who came to the U.S. only later in life. In fact, the vast majority of English learners are born here, but their cognitive and language skills are so low that they are deemed non-native English speakers. Nationally, 30 percent of all English learner students are third-generation Americans. In 2013, California Governor Jerry Brown pushed through a controversial law to try to close the achievement gap between Californias growing Hispanic population and its Anglo and Asian populations. That law redistributes tax dollars from successful schools to those with high proportions of English learners and low-income students. It remains to be seen whether this latest effort to raise the education outcomes of the children of low-skilled immigrants will prove more effective than its predecessors. Working against that possibility is Hispanics high dropout ratethe highest in the state and the nationand their equally unmatched teen pregnancy rate. To be sure, many illegal Hispanic aliens possess an admirable work ethic and have stabilized some moribund inner-city areas like South Central Los Angeles. But thanks to their lack of social capital, many of their children and grandchildren are getting sucked into underclass culture. The Hispanic out-of-wedlock birth rate in California and the U.S. is 53 percenttwice what it was in the black population in 1965 when Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote his prescient warning about the catastrophe of black family breakdown. The incarceration rate of Mexican-Americans in California shoots up eight-fold between the first and second generations, to equal the black incarceration rate. Gang involvement is endemic in barrio schools, giving rise to a vast taxpayer-supported army of anti-gang counselors serving the children of single mothers. This social service bureaucracy in barrio schools is just the tip of the iceberg. Welfare use among immigrants and their progeny is stubbornly high, because their poverty rates are stubbornly high. Hispanics are the biggest users of government health care and the biggest supporters of Obamacare. They favor big government and the higher taxes necessary to pay for it. The claim that low-skilled immigration is an economic boon to the country as a whole is false. It fails to take into account the government services consumed by low-skilled immigrants and their children, such as schools, hospitals, and prisons. *** So what should be done? First of all, we must reassert the primacy of the rule of law. At the very least, that means rehabilitating deportation and ceasing to normalize illegal immigration with our huge array of sanctuary policies. Liberals appear indifferent to the erosion of law, and even too many conservatives are willing to excuse immigration law-breaking in order to placate what they imagine to be a conservative voting bloc in waiting. But let us hope the rule of law is not lost. I would not at present offer an amnesty to those who have voluntarily chosen to violate the law, since every amnesty, both in the U.S. and Europe, has had one effect and one effect only: more illegal immigration. People who come into the country illegally or overstay their visas do so knowingly. They assume the risk of illegal status; it is not our moral responsibility to wipe it away. Their children, if they are born here, are already American citizens, thanks to the misguided policy of birthright citizenship. The illegal status of their parents is a problem that will eventually fade away as that first generation dies out. The Obama amnesty, however, actually incentivizes the use of birthright citizenship, since it rewards with legal status illegal aliens who have American citizen children. I would also radically reorient our legal immigration system towards high skilled immigrants like the parents of Googles founder, Sergey Brin. Canada, Australia, and other countries are already benefiting from placing a priority on skilled immigrants. Immigration policy should be forged with one consideration in mind: Americas economic self-interest. Immigration is not a service we provide to the rest of the world. Yes, we are a nation of immigrants and will continue to be one. No other country welcomes as many newcomers. But rewarding illegal immigration does an injustice to the many legal immigrants who played by the rules to get here. We owe it to them and to ourselves to adhere to the law.

GA News - Homeschoolers win Build A Plane competition!@#​ The General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) and Build A Plane report that the Christian Home Educators Fellowship (CHEF) Homeschoolers in Cuba City, Wisconsin, won the third Aviation Design Challenge to promote Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) knowledge among U.S. high school students. Four students, a teacher, and a chaperone will receive an all-expenses-paid trip to Glasair Aviation in Arlington, Washington, to build a Glasair Sportsman airplane from June 8-19. More than 70 schools in 31 states and Washington, D.C., entered the competition, which required that each team have at least one male and at least female student. The teams used “ Fly to Learn ” curricula and training to learn the fundamentals of aerospace engineering and flight, and software powered by X-Plane to apply what they learned to modify and fly a virtual Glasair Sportsman airplane. Each school was scored on how much payload the plane carried, how much fuel it used, and the time the flight took. Judges from GAMA’s engineering team selected the winning team, taking into consideration the design features based on what the students applied from the curriculum. The students also submitted a one-page essay about how the competition increased their knowledge of STEM. “The GAMA competition has taught us the importance of teamwork, creativity, and critical thinking,” the students wrote. “We learned a great deal about STEM, how to test our aircraft consistently, and how to make very finite changes to our plane to get better results. The competition has been an excellent learning experience for us!” GAMA President and CEO Pete Bunce said, “I am very excited that, once again, GAMA will be partnering with Build A Plane, Glasair, and Jeppesen to support this amazing educational opportunity for these talented young men and women. To have this many high school students participate in the design and flight simulation portion of this competition is exactly the type of STEM education we get excited about as manufacturers. I look forward to meeting this year’s group of exceptional winners and to working with them to build the airplane.” “Build A Plane is pleased to be involved for a third year in this important educational initiative to help bring the joy of learning STEM education to high school students across the United States,” said the organization’s Executive Director Debbie Phillips. “This outstanding learning program allows students not only to learn STEM skills but to put those skills to work by building a real airplane—there’s really nothing like it!” Paolo Buonfante had already decided to build a Glasair Sportsman airplane through the company’s “Two Weeks to Taxi” program, but said the once-in-a-lifetime experience of working with the students, under Glasair’s supervision, appealed to him. “I’m very excited to be part of this educational program and to share the incredible experience of building an airplane with these students as they are introduced to the aviation industry,” Buonfante said. “This exceptional opportunity to build a plane and literally fly it across the country — from Washington state to Miami, where I live — is very special for me. I hope it will also be a positive and unique experience for these students for many years to come.” GAMA member companies are supplying round-trip airfare, hotels, meals, and field trips to nearby aviation sites of interest. GAMA and Jeppesen officials will be present during the build to offer assistance. “We are very pleased to welcome another group of students to Glasair for the Build A Plane program this June,” said Glasair President Nigel Mott. “Every year these kids walk away energized about building a future in aviation. It is exciting to see so many companies in the industry stepping up to support this event year after year.” To watch the plane being built, visit GAMA’s Facebook page.

GA News - AOPA president tells Congress reform critical to GA’s future!@#Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) President Mark Baker reinforced his message that medical and certification reform are critical to the future of general aviation during a U.S. House of Representatives Aviation Subcommittee roundtable held April 30. Mark Baker with his Piper Super Cub. Baker told the panel that GA needs support from Congress in order to grow — support in the form of passage of the Pilot’s Bill of Rights 2, which includes third-class medical reform — as well as regulatory changes that will make it easier and less expensive to produce smarter aircraft and install modern safety equipment in legacy aircraft. He added that general aviation has made “great strides in terms of safety in recent decades, and that continued safety improvements will come from additional education and technological advances, not from government regulation or oversight.” Baker also noted the educational efforts of the AOPA Air Safety Institute, which produces hundreds of free education and analysis products aimed at improving GA safety. He also pointed to recent successful industry-government collaborations that have led to changes in the pilot certification process, efforts to reduce loss of control accidents, and regulations to help safety integrate unmanned aircraft into the national airspace system. Baker delivered similar testimony two days earlier at a U.S. Senate Aviation Subcommittee hearing on GA safety. Both the roundtable and the hearing are part of the FAA reauthorization process, in which Congress will set long-term funding for the FAA. In addition to Baker and subcommittee members, the roundtable included representatives of the NTSB, the Department of Transportation’s Inspector General’s office, the Regional Airline Association and of the Families of Continental Flight 3407.!@#english

Dual Language Schools in Denver / Boulder Area!@#My family will be moving to the Denver/Boulder area sometime within the next year. I presently have my elementary school children in a very high quality (10/10 on Great Schools rating) public school Dual Language (Spanish) program in a different state. As I research all the public school Dual Language programs/schools in the Denver/Boulder region, I am finding that they are all rated very low. Does anyone know if this is because these schools are truly struggling or if it is just because the standardized tests in Colorado are only given in English, so the test scores poorly reflect the educational level of many of the Spanish speakers in these schools?

The gospel according to Jobs!@#Steve Jobs in 1988; and launching the iPod mini in 2004. Source: Supplied  Steve Jobs’ ten tips for running a business were delivered to the IT faithful at the CeBIT Australia expo this week like Moses bringing down the Ten Commandments. And the faithful were grateful, not only to have received the hallowed tips, but to have received them second-hand. As Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki, who knew Jobs well, said during his keynote speech at CeBIT, Jobs was a fearful presence in person who routinely humiliated people in front of their peers. Mr Kawasaki recalled an incident where Jobs asked him for an opinion of a company called Knoware, an educational software firm. Kawasaki branded it as mediocre giving Jobs a litany of criticisms as to why. Jobs then said, “Well Guy, I want to introduce you to the CEO”, who was standing right next to him. “But I passed the IQ test because if I had said that was a great company, I would have lost,” Mr Kawasaki said. Mr Kawasaki’s keynote centred on the 10 lessons he learnt working for Jobs, who he said had helped God create “Universe 2.0”. Here they are: 1. Ignore naysayers. A negative or pessimistic attitude doesn’t work in a great technology company. He cited a Western Union internal memo in 1876 which described the telephone as having no value, with too many shortcoming — it wrote off telephony. 2. Don’t listen to your customers. Rather, go with your vision, passion and insight. He said customers in the mid 1980s wanted a bigger, faster and cheaper version of Apple 2, but Apple instead built the Macintosh — a totally unrelated device. 3. Great innovation is on the next curve, not the current one. He cited the example of ice makers, made redundant by the advent of ice factories, but after 30 years they weren’t the companies that developed refrigerators — the next curve. “Most companies start on a curve and die on the same curve because they define their business as what they currently do,” he said. 4. Design counts. Apple was successful because of the way it designed its products, as the millennial generation understood. He said you don’t see pictures of millennials using a big black ugly laptop, except in stock photography. 5. Democratisation is a good thing. Apple is in the business of democratisation, he said. The Apple 1, 2 and MacIntosh changed the game by making technology available to people who didn’t have access previously. 6. Use big graphics and big fonts in slide presentations. Jobs chose 200 points for the main fonts and 90 points after that. When you communicate, less is more. Apple has a 10-20-30 rule for Powerpoint presentations: 10 slides, 20 minutes and a 30-point font. 7. Changing your mind is a sign of intelligence and courage. It does not indicate weakness and cowardice. The 2007 iPhone, for example, was not originally intended to have stand-alone apps, and any app for it was to be a Safari plugin. Jobs changed his mind. The rest is history. 8. Value is different to price. Value includes the total impact of the product, not just its price. 9. Always hire people better than yourself. If you are an A, hire A+. however, in reality, a B manager hires C workers, and a C hires a D. Before you know it, your company is flooded with Z workers. 10. Products need to be both valuable and unique. The Macintosh was successful because it had both. A product that is valuable but not unique will end up in a price battle. Uniqueness without value, meanwhile, was a case of “you are just being stupid.” Dotcom companies were typically neither unique nor valuable, Mr Kawasaki said. This story was first published in The Australian Business Review.!@#english

Wooing the moderates: democrats stand firm!@#Four - that is the margin between success and failure for the government as it campaigns for support to pass the controversial political reform package now before the Legislative Council. Going by those who have declared their stance, the administration is still short of four crucial votes to shepherd through the electoral blueprint, which needs the backing of two-thirds of the 70-member Legco to be approved. All the pan-democratic parties have shut the door on any backtracking of their vociferous objection to the restrictive framework set by Beijing that will see only two or three candidates get the support of a 1,200-member nominating committee to run for chief executive in 2017. Enter the independent and seemingly moderate lawmakers who now appear to be the government's major lobbying target. Might four of them be persuaded to support the package? In interviews with the South China Morning Post , six lawmakers - frequently dubbed the "key suspects" most likely to be persuaded - insist they remain firmly opposed to the reforms. But even at this advanced hour, they say some concessions - which are highly unlikely - might move them. Ronny Tong Ka-wah, long regarded as a dissident in the Civic Party because of his moderate stance, is among the six interviewed. He advocated a middle-of-the-road plan last year, proposing an overhaul of the composition of the nominating committee to make it more representative even if candidates were not chosen directly by the public. Another is Frederick Fung Kin-kee, the sole representative of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood in Legco. He is one of the legislators who have expressed in the strongest terms their wish to meet central government officials before the legislature votes. He is hoping for a breakthrough deal at the last-minute. It would not be the first time Fung had backed an eleventh-hour deal. Despite earlier objections, Fung and another lawmaker, health service representative Dr Joseph Lee Kok-long, voted for a compromise 2012 reform package which allowed 3.2 million voters to elect five new lawmakers. The candidates are pre-vetted by district councillors rather than directly elected as originally proposed. Ivan Choy Chi-keung, a political scientist, believes the government is trying to snatch votes from non-affiliated lawmakers as it is highly unlikely it can win votes from major pro-democracy parties. "I cannot see how the government can get any votes from the parties given their bad relationship with each other," he says, citing Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying's ban on his ministers and political appointees attending the Democratic Party's anniversary dinner in February. "Would you worsen the relationship this way if you truly want the Democrats' votes?" But Choy concedes that a better relationship may not translate into votes. He believes for now the moderates look set to face punishment later at the polls from pan-democrat supporters if they say yes. "It's not the case that these lawmakers can cast the vote in favour of the proposal and simply leave the political arena immediately. They still have to stay and work on the local legislation of the reform afterwards … the pressure and attacks on them could be tough," says Choy. Still, if they say no to the package, the prospect of tension erupting in the city is a gamble they seem prepared to make. But the other scenario of an escalation of protests if the reform package is passed by a razor-thin margin - helped by the so-called pan-democratic defectors - is also likely, this camp says. Whichever way the vote goes, Hong Kong must brace itself for a summer of discontent. Charles Mok may not be affiliated to any party in Hong Kong, but this does not make him an easy target for government approval When Charles Mok first entered the legislature three years ago, the information technology sector lawmaker expected to be seen as one of the government’s key lobbying targets on political reform because he is not affiliated to any party. But two months ahead of the Legislative Council’s vote on the reform package, Mok is sending a clear message to the government and its loyalists: securing votes from individual and functional constituency lawmakers is by no means easier than getting them from those who are party-affiliated and popularly-elected. He also dismisses the widely-held assumption voters from functional constituencies tend to be more conservative and thus more keen to back the restrictive reform plan – which pan-democrats believe will effectively bar anyone Beijing dislikes from running for the city’s top job. “I’m not textile and garment sector lawmaker Felix Chung Kwok-pan nor banking sector legislator Ng Leung-sing – whose seats are determined by corporate voters who are really conservative,” Mok, 50, says. The IT sector is not exactly the bastion of conservatives, he says. “It is a myth to argue that functional constituency lawmakers face larger pressure from voters should they veto the reform plan.” Mok points to the young people from his sector who earlier placed a full-page advertisement in Chinese-language daily Ming Pao to oppose the “undemocratic” reform package. He points out polls have shown people with higher educational attainment or professional backgrounds tended to reject the plan. On April 22, Mok joined the walkout staged by pan-democratic lawmakers to express opposition to the electoral blueprint that Chief Secretary Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor unveiled in Legco. But he and four other pan-democrats also stayed away from a media briefing by their colleagues that day. Mok’s conspicuous absence fuelled speculation he could still change his position at crunch time when the votes are counted in Legco. However, he doused all murmurings when he told reporters not to read too much into his actions and that he would vote no to the package. At this late hour, it would be impossible for the government to win his backing. He wants changes to Beijing’s framework, which stipulates that only two or three candidates approved by the majority of the 1,200-member nominating committee can run for chief executive. His demands include scrapping the cap on the number of candidates and lowering the approval threshold to 12.5 per cent, which government officials have repeatedly dismissed. He says the current threshold reflects Beijing’s lack of trust in Hongkongers and this “vetting mechanism” must be scrapped. Mok will also not be basing his decision on the majority views of his constituents. He does not plan to gauge their sentiments as he believes there is no way he can reach out to everyone in his sector fairly. Some IT associations have been reluctant to send out questionnaires as they want to stay politically neutral, he adds. In any case, he insists his voters’ preference will not be the overriding factor in casting his historic vote. “People could decide not to elect me again if they don’t agree with my stance,” he says. Mok also believes a veto could “avert a crisis” for the government, as passing the contentious plan would only deepen the divide. For now, Mok says he will not feel bad to be among a clutch of moderates labelled as possible swing votes. He says: “Misunderstandings will not last forever as I will cast my vote eventually.” Jeffie Lam!@#english

!@#Here we have a unique situation. A very independent young teenager taking her destination in her own hands with her parents passively standing aside. Or actually it is more a common phenomenon than we are aware of? . Educating the young always has been for generations feverishly dominated by parents. Parents would fight tooth to nail to maintain the status Quote: of the privileged schools or fighting for enrollment in one. No fundamental question asked by parents if investing twelve schooling years by their children aren’t a total waste. . In my view it is obviously Hong Kong parents like those in the mainland are focusing what their children could achieve educationally beyond after the first twelve years of schooling. It is all about how fitting into and become privileged member in a society of great pitfalls that inequality flourishes. Such truly is the education purpose in Hong Kong. . Education and society are one. They are only separated by time in the transition of the impressionable to the diehard. Both need reform in Hong Kong and without doing so that is why studying abroad are necessary.!@#english

Bloomingdale teachers protest cut of transportation coordinator's position - Education!@#The faculty has come out in support of a fellow staff member whose position is on the chopping block as part of the district's cost-saving efforts. The district has been hit with more than $200,000 in additional costs since the preliminary budget was introduced. Dorothy Bannon's position as the district's transportation, facilities and maintenance coordinator is slated for elimination. In a statement read at the May 4 school board meeting, Bannon said her position has been abolished and her responsibilities will be outsourced to the Passaic County Educational Services Commission in an attempt to reduce costs. Bannon has worked for the school district for 13 years and is reportedly 18 months shy of retirement. "I find myself looking back and examining what my position entailed and who will be most affected by the change," she said. "My overwhelming answer is the children. From the transportation contracts and field trips to the after-school organizations or helping teachers with their classroom needs, my goal has been to put the children first." Bannon expressed doubt that the switch to a large agency not familiar with the district's students and families would be worth the savings. She questioned if the district's needs could be addressed as efficiently under the commission's oversight. "While everyone must strive to balance a budget, I would like the board to remember that this is not a corporate business. This is a school district. A school district is not the bricks and the mortar, but the children and the families and the teachers and staff that make up the Bloomingdale school community. They should be the first priority," she said. Bannon's comments were met with applause by the teachers in the audience who were wearing red shirts in a sign of solidarity. Maureen Jacobs, a math teacher at Bloomingdale's Walter T. Bergen School, said the district has utilized the county services in the past and was not happy with the results. "She only has 18 months to retirement. That's what bothers us most. I feel very bad for Dottie, and I hope the savings is worth what Dottie is going through," said Jacobs. After this public comment portion of the meeting, a presentation was delivered on the 2015-16 school budget revealing that the district was hit with substantial additional costs after the preliminary budget was sent to the county superintendent's office for approval. According to George Hagl, the school district's business administrator, the district experienced $214,310 in extra costs primarily because of added special education placements. Rather than effectuate cuts to make up for the shortfall, the school district is applying for extraordinary aid. If the aid is not received, school officials said cuts will likely have to made, which could include reductions in staffing. After the meeting, Hagl said the elimination of Bannon's position and the move to the county educational services commission will save the district approximately $50,000.

View photo . The index was developed exclusively by U.S. News & World Report as an ongoing way to track health care's changing role in the U.S. economy and society. The first series of data, from 2000 to 2013, presents a comprehensive overview of the U.S. health care system by following movements in health care expenditures, medical costs, insurance coverage, health care employment, international comparisons and health care degrees granted in the United States. "There is an ongoing narrative about health care's central role in the U.S. economy, but this index demonstrates all of the ways health care is touching every aspect of our society," said Tim Smart, executive editor of U.S. News. "The Health Care Index will allow us to better understand how the health care system is evolving and its broader influence over time." The index shows a steady trend upwards between 2000 and 2013. The largest components – health care expenditures and employment – drive the trend. Key insights from the U.S. News Health Care Index: An expansion of public health insurance : Though data from the Affordable Care Act are not measured in the first iteration of the index, the federal government's expanded role is already apparent. Government-sponsored health care, including Medicare and Medicaid, have grown at a faster rate than private health insurance. The total percentage of people under the age of 65 with public health insurance coverage increased from 12.9 percent in 2000 to 23.8 percent in 2013. Private health insurance coverage decreased from 71.8 percent to 61 percent during the same period. A surge in individual's health care costs: Americans have taken on a higher burden of health care costs, spending 1.7 times more out-of-pocket on health care by 2013. The average cost of deductibles more than doubled over the course of a decade. The percent of premiums paid by employees increased by roughly 4 percent for both single and family plans, taking up a larger share of individual incomes. Meanwhile, there has been a 55 percent growth in prescription drug consumer prices. A dominant role in the U.S. economy: In 2012, the U.S. spent 17.9 percent of its GDP on health care, more than any other developed nation. Health care's share of the job market has declined since 2011, but health care jobs have steadily increased every year, from 9.7 million in 2000 to 12.5 million in 2013. There continues to be an uptick in undergraduate and graduate health care degrees granted. From 2000 to 2013, associate degrees increased 142 percent, bachelors grew by 126 percent and graduate degrees increased by 94 percent. The U.S. News Health Care Index features a collection of interactive graphs so that users can easily explore the data, research specific data points and adjust the graphs to illustrate trends. The index (read full methodology ) is made up of 36 data sets organized into eight sub-indices: health care expenditures, employment, insurance, education, insurance premiums, consumer price, insurance deductibles, and international economic impact. The index relies on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Center for Educational Statistics and the World Health Organization.

Govt relaxes norms for residence certificate, but students say it’s too late!@#Govt relaxes norms for residence certificate, but students say it’s too late Details Created on Thursday, 07 May 2015 09:49 Published on Thursday, 07 May 2015 09:49 Font Size:  PANAJI: The government on Wednesday exempted those students who have continuously resided in Goa from submitting residence certificate to seek admission to professional degree or diploma, giving a major relief to the students just before the declaration of HSSC results.As per a circular issued by under secretary (revenue) Anju Kerkar, the government accepted the recommendation of the committee on simplification of procedures for effective delivery of public services and decided to exempt the continuously residing students from submitting the document for admission. The circular reads, “For the purpose of admission in educational institutions, the student who has studied continuously in the state of Goa for the required period and it is established from the school record that he/she is ‘continuously resident’ of state of Goa, is not required to produce a residence certificate from the mamlatdar of the taluka. However, he/she has to produce copy of school record and any other document to support claim of residence.” The circular further states, “In case there is any major break in the education, however the residence is continued in the state of Goa, the student is required to produce the documentary evidence or certificate from the mamlatdar that during the break period he/she was in Goa.” The order, which will be beneficial for the students in the long run, has evoked mixed reactions from the student fraternity. Most of the students who will seek admission for medical, technical or professional courses have already obtained the domicile certificate. They feel the decision has come very late as they have already gone through the hardships of obtaining the certificate. Asif Bilal, who answered the GCET, expressed anguish saying that the order has come after he had received the residence certificate.“I have spent so much money and time in getting my RC so that I wouldn’t have to face hardship during admission, and with this order coming so late, all the hardships went in vain,” Asif rued. Concurring with Asif, another student said that though the step is a welcome one but it might not benefit the students this year as the students seeking admissions this year must have already received or applied for the certificate. A student of the DMC’s HSS, Mapusa, said that he would still apply for the certificate so as to avoid any inconvenience during the admission process. Sources in the education department said that admissions are granted strictly against the process mentioned in the prospectus, which must have been printed by now. However, the circular directs the concerned educational institutes to carry out necessary corrections in the prospectus. During the beginning of the academic year the mamlatdar offices across the state would see a rush of applications to seek residence certificate, which was a pinch on the pockets of the parents and would put extra burden on the officials of the mamlatdar.

‘I wasn’t sure if we could make it out alive”: Singapore doctor caught in Nepal quake - Channel NewsAsia!@#Caption  SINGAPORE: April 25 started as just another day in Chalnakhel, a village in Nepal about seven kilometres from the capital of Kathmandu. A group of 13 Singaporeans were at New Life Handicap Ministry, one day into their 10-day trip to work with the non-governmental organisation (NGO).  Packed into a room at the basement of the Ministry’s prayer tower, the Singaporeans and their Nepalese hosts were in the middle of a service when the earth shook beneath their feet. Someone shouted: “Earthquake! Earthquake!” and everyone rushed out of the room, and up into the open courtyard next to the building.  One of the team leaders, Joshua Chua, recounted the moment: “We all felt a very violent tremor, and ran out of the service room. It was chaotic during those initial moments, and I wasn’t sure if all my team members were safe or got trapped in the building.  “I wasn’t sure we could make it out alive. After all, we’re Singaporeans, and are not really prepared for natural disasters such as this.”  Dr Chua, 29, is a medical doctor in the public primary healthcare landscape who was in Nepal in his personal capacity. He is also a director of Seeds of Nations, a Christian NGO that focuses on “projects that bring health and education to needy people in different parts of the world”, the doctor told Channel NewsAsia in an interview on Wednesday (May 7).  The team had travelled to Nepal to work with two of Seeds of Nations’ longstanding partners: New Life Handicap Ministry, a Kathmandu-based home that takes in both the physically and mentally handicapped who have been ostracised by society, and New Hope Ministry, which helps trafficked and/or trafficked men, women and children. The team was mostly comprised of doctors and social workers, he said.  “IT WAS QUITE AMAZING”  Out in the open, Dr Chua saw that the prayer tower they were in just moments ago was relatively unscathed. Around them, however, neighbouring buildings were not so lucky: Some were damaged from the 7.8-magnitude earthquake, while others were destroyed.  “It was really quite amazing to see that our building was standing and unharmed,” he said. “Also amazing was the truck the Ministry had was also untouched and functional. We really thanked God for that.” A collapsed temple structure was salvaged and brought to the middle of the road by locals. (Photo: Joshua Chua)  However, the local government deemed all buildings unfit for living, and the team and their hosts had to relocate to an adjacent vegetable farm. It became a communal shelter, as others from neighbouring buildings also took refuge there, he said.  Communications, too, were hit. For the first six hours, landline and mobile signals were down, and the team could not get in touch with anyone in Singapore. The only source of connection was a satellite phone, from which the head of New Life Handicap Ministry, Pastor Narayan, got intermittent information from local authorities.  The first 12 to 24 hours were the “most challenging”, said Dr Chua. In that first day after the quake hit, the team had no electrical supply and also ran out of water. The vegetable farm people were huddled in was also exposed to the elements - on top of rain in the night, there were also tigers and other roaming wild animals that posed a risk.

(Photo: Joshua Chua)  Compounding problems were reports that bandits were out on the streets to exploit the vulnerable during those initial moments following the earthquake, said Dr Chua.  Thankfully, the team eventually managed to get water from a nearby spring, and food from a wholesale market that remained open despite being damaged from the earthquake too, he said.

(Photo: Joshua Chua)  They were also able to get in touch with their loved ones in Singapore after the initial 24 hours, and Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also managed to check in on the team. A choice was then put to the team: Stay on and continue the work they had set out to do, or head to Kathmandu to be evacuated.  “A couple of the team members initially wanted to return home,” said Dr Chua. “However, due to various circumstances, they decided to stay on. In the end, after much deliberation and consultation with their family members, all 13 agreed to stay on and complete the 10-day trip.” Crowds milling at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu on the second day after the quake, as people looked to leave Nepal. (Photo: Joshua Chua)  LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES TO OFFER MEDICAL HELP  In the team, there were four doctors and a dentist. On the second day following the quake, they had offered their services to a local hospital and helped for a brief time with initial assessment and diagnosis of the patients streaming in.  In the end, all they could offer were basic medical services, said Dr Chua: “We were not plugged in to the national healthcare infrastructure, and could not operate on patients. There were also a lot of foreign medical workers starting to descend on Nepal, and the local healthcare staff had become more resistant to accepting aid from outside sources.”  Dr Chua's observation was confirmed by Nepalese authorities. Dr Khem Bdr Karki, who is coordinating overseas teams in Nepal through the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), told Channel NewsAsia on Wednesday (May 6) that there was an "oversupply" of medical personnel, but not enough medical supplies, water purification systems and personal hygiene kits. Patients being evacuated from the local hospital after a strong aftershock was felt a day after the initial earthquake. (Photo: Joshua Chua)  “HEARTWRENCHING SIGHT”  The team spent the following days interacting with the children and those living at the homes of New Life Handicap Ministry and New Hope Ministry. They held educational classes, spent time encouraging and praying for those affected by the quake, and helped in getting basic necessities such as water and food.

(Photo: Joshua Chua)  It was only on the second-last day of the trip, when conditions had somewhat stabilised and phone networks were up, that they managed to travel out of Chalnakhel towards some of the more outlying villages.  Led by Pastor Narayan, the team went to the wholesale market and bought supplies such as a quarter tonne of rice, 100kg of cabbage, dahl and water to distribute to needy families. The food rations such as cabbages that were distributed. These were vegetables that were salvaged from farms and sold to the team at 40 per cent off the usual rate.

(Photo: Joshua Chua)  Travelling down south and passing landmarks such as the Dakshinkali Temple, Dr Chua said he saw many people walking on foot or on overcrowded buses leaving scenes of devastated homes and shophouses. Local water and food distribution points were also filled with people, while those who have collected their portions make the slow trek back on foot to where their homes used to be.  “It was a heartwrenching sight,” he said. A long trek up mountainous areas were necessary to bring rations to families housed off the main roads. (Photo: Joshua Chua)  From what he had seen, Dr Chua said that as these places lack access to the public healthcare system, acute medical care and medicine are needed. Proper sanitation and temporary shelter such as tents and tarpaulin are also required, to prevent infectious diseases from setting in – a common problem following natural disasters, he added.  The 13 Singaporeans on the team eventually flew back to Singapore – on the original SilkAir commercial flight they had booked themselves on – on May 3.  Looking ahead, Dr Chua said he “definitely plans to return to Nepal in the next few months”, given the longstanding friendships and relationships established with their counterparts in the country.  As of Thursday, the death toll in Nepal has reached 7,675 , with more than 16,300 people injured, according to the government.
